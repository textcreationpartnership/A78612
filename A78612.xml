         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I ſhall a little reflect upon your text, and its context, and ſhew that this concluſion of yours, in the ſenſe mentioned, can of right claime no acquaintance with their import.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Revelations</hi> 18. <hi>Babylons</hi> ruine is ſet forth, 1 By the inſtrumental cauſes of it, the Word of Gods mouth denounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and drawing off her aſſociates from her, <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. 2 By the procuring cauſe of it, her foule Idolatries and ſeduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. 5. 3 By the conſequents of it, the ſorrowing and wailing of her followers and lovers, and the great joy of the Church and people of God, <hi>verſe</hi> 9, to 21. I ſhall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly conſider the four firſt verſes.</p>
               <p>Verſe 1. <hi>I ſaw another Angel come down from Heaven, &amp;c.

This Angel may alſo bee underſtood to ſignifie them, ſince he brings for ſubſtance no other meſſage than the former; onely his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is more clear, being neerer Antichriſts ruine; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. is ſaid to <hi>flie in the midſt of the Heavens;</hi> this Angel is ſaid to <hi>come down from Heaven, and to cry with a ſtrong voice, and the earth to bee enlightened with his glory.</hi> By this Angel, I underſtand the company of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the reformed Churches, that have been, and ſhall bee raiſed out of the bowels of the territories of Antichriſt, who, by their preaching and writing, <hi>enlighten the earth,</hi> that is, the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118995:8"/> common ſort of Chriſtians, who were before the footſtool of Antichriſt, and baſis of his Hierarchy.</p>
               <p>For though this was in a great meaſure done, at the pouring out of the firſt viall, upon the Throne of the Beaſt, when the <hi>Waldenſes, Albigenſes, Huſſites, &amp;c.</hi> began every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the authority of the beaſt, calling <hi>Rome</hi> eccleſiaſtical, the <hi>Apocalyptical Babylon:</hi> Yet this vial, is as yet poured out but in part, as are alſo ſeverall others of the Vials: The <hi>dregs</hi> of them, and of this in particular, remaining to bee poured upon the beaſt, in a doctrinal way by this Angel, who ſhall give the laſt warning of <hi>Babylons</hi> inſtant ruine. The effect whereof is, that the <hi>earth is inlightned,</hi> that is, many more of the common people, are drawn off from communion with <hi>Babylon,</hi> and joyn iſſue with ſome of the ten horns, fallen off from the Whore, and hating her. But as for her more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſlaves and vaſſals, they receive no benefit by the Miniſtery of this Angell, but either periſh in <hi>Babylons</hi> ruine, or by the dregs of the vials poured out upon her aſſociates.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118995:9"/> and to diſclaim and reject the uſurped power of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, both in temporals, and eſpecially in ſpirituals.

From theſe Texts, I obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That Antichriſts ſin lies principally in this, that hee cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all, under great penalties, to <hi>receive the mark of the name of the beaſt, in their right hands or foreheads;</hi> that is, to own the <hi>univerſal headſhip of the Pope,</hi> eſpecially in ſpirituals: So that no point of Chriſtian faith muſt bee received, unleſs warranted by his authority, and whatſoever is ſtampt with his authority, muſt bee owned, though never ſo contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſin of his followers, lyeth in this, that they reſign up themſelves in obedience to the Pope, and make him ſoveraign Lord over their perſons, rights, and conſciences, in all things; <hi>receiving,</hi> owning, pleading, fighting for, his abominable Doctrines, worſhip and uſurpation. Kings themſelves, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their crowns to him, and maintaining by their Laws, and edicts, his blaſphemous doctrines, and tyranny.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thoſe onely are threatned, to <hi>partake of Babylons plagues,</hi> that <hi>partake with her in her ſins.</hi> And who thoſe are, the Holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.16, 17. All, and onely they, that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a marke, the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name, in their right hand, or in their fore-head.</hi> That is, that own the uſurped authority of the Pope, and his doctrines and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, becauſe ſtampt with his authority, which whoſoever doth to the death, cannot bee ſaved, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.3. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſet forth, and confirmed for ſuch, by the <hi>Tridentine Council,</hi> is this <hi>Sea,</hi> conſiſting of the popiſh errors collected into one body, as many waters meet in the Sea. The Angell that turned this <hi>Sea into bloud,</hi> might bee among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Martin Chemuitius,</hi> who poured out his vial on it, when hee wrote his Examination of the Trent Council. And <hi>every Soul living in this Sea dyed,</hi> whoſoever owneth the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as ſet forth by that Councill, and dies in that Faith, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſaved; for what the Apoſtle ſaith of one of its anti-Scriptural doctrines, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. may be ſaid of all of them that raſe the foundation.</p>

And among ſuch are, the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> in <hi>England, Scotland, Holland, France, Germany, &amp;c.</hi> profeſſing the ſound doctrines of the Goſpel, in oppoſition to Antichriſts Idolatries. How thoſe Churches that diſown, and reject the corrupt doctrine, and worſhip of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and have ſealed their witneſs againſt them with their blood, being by their profeſſion and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, the inſtruments whereby God hath ſhaken the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Beaſt; How theſe Churches ſhould yet bee An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian limbs of the Beaſt, may well bee a <hi>Myſtery</hi> to all conſiderate and unprejudiced men.</p>
               <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>P.</hi> beleeves, that <hi>none,</hi> ſave a few <hi>ſeparate Churches,</hi> named <hi>Congregational,</hi> are yet come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (which the <hi>Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> plead each for themſelves) I have one text to offer to his conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, which is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="1">1 By the <hi>Lamb,</hi> is undoubtedly meant the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Mount-Sion</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Goſpel-Church, to the Church Antichriſtian.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The 144000 that <hi>ſtand upon Mount-Sion</hi> (a definite number for an indefinite) and have <hi>their Fathers name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their fore-heads,</hi> muſt therefore bee members of the <hi>true Church,</hi> in oppoſition to the members of the <hi>Church of Anti-Chriſt,</hi> who have his name, or mark in their right hand or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
               <p n="4">4 By their having their Fathers name written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, is therefore hinted, their keeping cloſe, in the main, to Gods inſtitutions, in profeſſion and worſhip, in oppoſition to the Idolatries of the Antichriſtian Church. Which further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that it is ſaid, that <hi>they are not defiled with women, verſ.</hi> 4. that is, with the Idolatries of the great Whore.

               <p n="5">

That their ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſynchronizeth with the ſtanding of the Antichriſtian Church, appeareth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.16, 17. with the four firſt verſes of the 14th. Chapter. For the company of the Lambs marked ones, is oppoſite to the Beaſts whole marked company, whilſt it was ſuch; whilſt the Church-State of the Beaſt was falſe and corrupt, the Church-State of the 144000 was true. And it is ſaid, they were not defiled with women, which argues that the Whore was at the time of their ſtanding, ſeducing.

               <p>Now ſeeing the <hi>Congregational Churches</hi> are as it were but of yeſterday: who are thoſe 144000 that have ſtood with the Lamb upon <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> all along the time of Antichriſts reign? Either you muſt aſſert the <hi>loſs of a true Church-State</hi> in the world for many ages paſt; or elſe you muſt acknowledge, that the Churches that have maintained a true profeſſion, all along the time of Antichriſts reign, were true Churches, and that the <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> that have owned and maintained the ſame profeſſion to this day, have been, and are <hi>true Churches,</hi> and are in the number of the 144000. If you dare not ſay the former (as I ſuppoſe you do not) you muſt confeſs the latter; and then, with what face or reaſon will you juſtifie that ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them, as <hi>Antichriſtian Churches,</hi> which you contend for?</p>
               <p>Conſider, I beſeech you, what you have to anſwer for before the Lord, in branding all the Chriſtian Churches in the world, from the riſe of Antichriſt to this day, who have diſowned and oppoſed him (except a few ſeparate Congregations of theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daies) as falſe and Antichriſtian Churches.

               <p>That the Church is not <hi>of the world,</hi> all grant; but that it ſhould not bee <hi>in the world,</hi> is ſtrange.

               <p>If it bee ſaid, wee have no example of a National Church in the time of the Apoſtles, nor yet in the times of the primitive Church: This cannot bee an objection of weight.

Your borrowed relation, concerning <hi>Cletus</hi> and <hi>Evariſtus,</hi> is not much to bee valued, as neither are moſt of the Hiſtories of the Church, for the firſt three hundred years. And if this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation were true, the thing is ſtill <hi>unproved;</hi> for I finde it record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who as ſome ſay, was <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and ſuffered Martyrdome in the eleventh year of <hi>Trajan;</hi> that being ſent from <hi>Syria,</hi> becauſe hee profeſſed Chriſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> where hee ſuffered; when hee paſſed thorough <hi>Aſia,</hi> hee ſtrengthened and confirmed the <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> through all the Cities, as hee went, with his exhortations and preaching. So that theſe <hi>Pariſhes</hi> are ancienter than thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> But, if it were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Pariſhes had their Original at <hi>Rome,</hi> about the time you ſpeak of, it makes not to your purpoſe, and that for two Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> then was, and long after continued to bee a pure Church of Chriſt, affording many Martyrs, that ſealed the truth with their blood; therefore diviſion of Pariſhes is not in its Original from Antichriſt. But, you think you have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented this anſwer ſufficiently, by ſaying, <q>Neither doth it help,<note place="margin">P. 13.</note> that Pariſh-Churches derive their pedigree from times ſo neer the Apoſtles, for the mystery of iniquity did work even in <hi>Pauls</hi> time.</q> If you could prove that the myſtery of iniquity ſprung up in <hi>Rome,</hi> or chiefly there, in the <hi>Apoſtles daies,</hi> you would have ſome (though but a ſlender and inſufficient) ground to think that Pariſhes, if they began there, are Antichriſtian.</p>
               <p>But, from Scripture, and Church-hiſtory, no ſuch thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. In the Apoſtles daies, <hi>Diotrephes</hi> is charged with aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118995:12"/> towards an univerſal Headſhip, 3 <hi>John</hi> 9, 10. The Church of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> mingleth works with Chriſts righteouſneſs for juſtification, and are by this peece of Popery in danger of the loſs of ſalvation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. The doctrine of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of Angels, creeps in Apoſtle-times into the Church of <hi>Coloſſe, Col.</hi> 2.18. But all this while, the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> keeps her garments undefiled, of theſe, and the like abominations, and for a ſound profeſſion of faith, is famous throughout the whole Chriſtian world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8. And long after this, and even in that very time, wherein you ſuppoſe the diviſion of <hi>Rome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pariſhes, the Saints there ſacrificed their lives in the flames to God, in the maintenance of the profeſſion of the Chriſtian doctrine. And yet Mr. <hi>P.</hi> is ſo charitable, that to maintain a <hi>Fable</hi> that hee thinks will ſerve his turne, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt needs bee then <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Becauſe it cannot bee made to appear, that Pariſh divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as ſuch, have in them the leaſt <hi>evil,</hi> or appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Without diviſions according to co-habitation, within certain bounds, Chriſtians cannot conveniently meet to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, nor Miniſters and people diſcharge their mutual duties. I no way doubt, but that they have ever been in uſe, when they might bee had, in the Church of God. The Jews had their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Synagogues</hi> for ſeveral vicinities. And it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Apoſtles in planting Churches, obſerved ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, as farre as might bee; <hi>They ordained them Elders in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City,</hi> But in many Cities, the Church conſiſted in each of ſeveral Congregations (as ſhall bee evidenced, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.) and 'tis moſt probable, that theſe were diſtinguiſhed, to attend on their reſpective Elders, according to the neerneſs of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, to the ſeveral meeting-places. However, beleevers are ſtill found in Scripture, to have eccleſiaſtically imbodied in the places of their habitation, as thoſe in <hi>Epheſus, Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> And is not this ſufficient warrant for <hi>Parochial Congregations,</hi> as ſuch, that is, the Eccleſiaſtical imbodying of ſuch, in a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as profeſs the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>But now, the way of gathering Churches, uſed by moſt of the <hi>Congregational</hi> Brethren, and your ſelf, picking ſome out of one Pariſh, and ſome out of another, and that without the leave, and againſt the mind of their godly Miniſters (who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after reformation, and the uſe of all Ordinances, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118995:12"/> to Gods mind in their places, but are hindered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to your might, by your ſiniſter dealings) and ſome of thoſe members, ſo many miles diſtant that you are thereby utterly diſabled from diſcharging mutual duties, this way and practice is altogether a ſtranger to the Word of God, and ſound reaſon, and hath <hi>more</hi> than an appearance of evil in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There is nothing in Scripture of limitation of Churches by the Miniſters function; or maintenance, by the edicts of Popes,<note place="margin">P. 13.</note> Biſhops, or Princes of this world. And it is enough againſt a thing belonging to the worſhip of God, that there is no inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for it, that the Scripture ſpeaks nothing of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then, ſurely it concerns <hi>you</hi> to look about you. Where have you an inſtitution for uniting in a ſingle Congregation, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers living at ſuch a <hi>diſtance</hi> from one another, as your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice doth? and undertaking to bee a <hi>Paſtor</hi> to a ſcattered peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, over whoſe ſouls it is impoſſible you ſhould <hi>watch?</hi> and urging an <hi>explicite Covenant,</hi> as neceſſary for admiſſion? &amp;c. As for <hi>limitation of Churches by the Miniſters function,</hi> how is your Church diſtinguiſhed from other Churches, but by your taking the charge of the members thereof, to watch for their ſouls? (how well or poſſible you can do it, it concernes you to ſee to) and is not this limitation of a Church, by the Miniſters function? That the Scripture ſaies nothing of Miniſters main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, by the edicts of Princes of this world, is true, if you mean <hi>de facto</hi> that Scripture gives no <hi>example</hi> of maintenance thus appointed and raiſed; Princes, when the Goſpel was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, had power to raiſe maintenance for the Miniſtery, but would not, being enemies to the Church. But to argue, that becauſe Scripture gives no example of it, Chriſtian <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who are by Scripture appointment, to bee <hi>nurſing Fathers and Mothers to the Church,</hi> may not by their Edicts, Laws, and Power ſettle a ſufficient revenue upon the Miniſters of the Church, is vain and frivolous; and the reſult of it is, which ſeems to bee your meaning, that the <hi>maintenance</hi> of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt bee by the <hi>peoples free will,</hi> and they muſt live upon the <hi>Almes of the Church.</hi> That this is not the mind of God, but that a certain liberal maintenance is by Gods ordinance due to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is from Scripture very clear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God eſtabliſhed a <hi>certain liberal Maintenance,</hi> for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118995:13"/> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> under the Law, as appeareth by the books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> And godly <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> quickened up by their royal commands, the backward people to pay it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.4, 5. whoſe examples are preceptive to <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrates</hi> now. And ſhall wee think that God bears a leſs tender reſpect to a <hi>Gospel,</hi> than to a <hi>Legal</hi> Miniſtery? neither appointing them a certain maintenance, nor means to raiſe it, if it bee with-held.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Dependance upon <hi>voluntary contributions,</hi> is the ready way to tempt Miniſters to bee the greateſt <hi>temporizers</hi> in the world, ſince it will force many of them to pleaſe their givers, or ſtarve.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Duties required of Miniſters under the Goſpel, call for a liberal and certain maintenance. They muſt <hi>bee given to hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:</hi> But they cannot exerciſe it, without a maintenance libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and certain.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That command to <hi>hearers</hi> of the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6, 7. leaves not men to their liberty, but chargeth a <hi>duty</hi> upon their conſciences, which they cannot neglect without <hi>mocking God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Miniſters may <hi>require</hi> this maintenance in an authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive way, as an abſolute due debt, for their work in the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Now, a liberal maintenance being by Gods <hi>Ordinance</hi> due to the Goſpel Miniſtery, what hinders, but that the fixing of it ſhould bee a lawful, yea a neceſſary means for their injoying of it. Before there were any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Magiſtrates in the world, the revenue of the Church was not altogether unſetled. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, being come to the Crown, enacts, that the Church Lands or goods, that had been injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly taken away, though annext to his own Crown, ſhould bee reſtored, that ſuch as had purchaſed Church-Lands, ſhould make preſent reſtitution of the ſame. Theſe lands and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions were, 'tis probable, long before purchaſed out of the publick bank of the mony laid at the <hi>Apostles feet,</hi> and other charitable donations ſince that time, and ſetled upon the Church, that ſo Miniſters having ſome certain maintenance, might ſerve God in their places with the leſs diſtraction. And therefore the building Oratories and Churches, and endowing them with maintenance, for the certain ſupport of fixed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which you make the object of your contempt, appears to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118995:13"/> bee in it ſelf conſidered, a lively imitation of primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, I demand,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Where a maintenance is already eſtabliſhed, and hath been ſo for many hundreds of years together, and that by as firme Laws as any man hath for his perſonal eſtate; Whether now, the Magiſtrate may not <hi>animate</hi> thoſe Laws, and make meet new ones, for the due payment of that eſtabliſhed mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did? 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Where maintenance is wanting, whether the Magiſtrate may not provide and ſettle it, by a <hi>levy</hi> upon the people? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'tis Gods ordinance there ſhould bee a liberal maintenance, and that many people, if left to themſelves, will rather want the Goſpel, than bee at charge for it; and that it is a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, to provide for the good of mens <hi>ſouls,</hi> and for the continuance, ſupport, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Miniſtery for that end.</p>
               <p>But to returne to <hi>Pariſh-Churches;</hi> you ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Conſider, what <hi>Babels</hi> of confuſion, and ſuperſtition they bee. Here you may ſee Saints and ſinners jumbled together, without any kindly ſeparation of the precious from the vile. Great care, that all may bee conſecrated, but the worſhippers. Are they not given unto the Gentiles?<note place="margin">P. 13, 19, 20</note> do not men of uncircumciſed hearts (for ſo are the Major part, in thoſe Churches) ſtand ſeized of the power of the keyes? Let us ſay to thoſe chriſtened Gentiles, that upon pretence of being of the ſame Religion, and Church with us, would intereſs themſelves, in rebuilding our Goſpel-Temple, as the Jews did to the Samaritanes, <hi>Ezra 4.1, 2, 3.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Specious arguments to take <hi>ignorant</hi> perſons. 'Tis common with thoſe of <hi>your way,</hi> to argue againſt the Church-ſtate of Churches, from the <hi>corruptions in manners</hi> which are found in them. Whereas the Scripture every where declares ſuch an arguing to bee of no force; witneſs its owning the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as ſuch, under its great, and ſeverely reprovered cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. So the degenrate Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> dead <hi>Sardis,</hi> and lukewarme and miſerable <hi>Laodicea.</hi> If a man fix his eye on thoſe Churches, under their then condition, and apply your charge to them (as hee may) and thence conclude, that they were <hi>no true Chruches,</hi> will hee not contradict the holy Ghoſt, and the Truth? and what then doth your arguing <hi>prove?</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:118995:14"/> Whatever corruption is in out Churches, wee make as much the matter of our <hi>grief,</hi> as you of your <hi>ſcorn,</hi> and are as ready to <hi>bear witneſs</hi> againſt it, as your ſelf; But not with you, to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi> the ſin of <hi>ſeparation,</hi> but to <hi>advance</hi> the duty of <hi>reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This many Church-guides do zealouſly indeavour after in our Churches, ſo unjuſt is your charge, generally faſtened upon them, that they <hi>take care, all may bee conſecrated, but the worſhippers,</hi> and that they <hi>make no kindly ſeparation, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious from the vile.</hi> You ſeem to make uſe of a bad rule, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniare fort it er aliquid haerebit.</hi> Your own knowledge of the contrary to your charge, in many Pariſh-Congregations, ſhould make you <hi>bluſh</hi> for theſe expreſſions. And truly that they are <hi>no more</hi> reformed, and others in no way for reformation, may bee as much aſcribed to the <hi>practices</hi> of your ſelf, and many of your way, in drawing off from them helpful members, and hindring endeavours for healing and reſtauration, as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſingle cauſe, yea as to many of them put together. And had not <hi>men of your way,</hi> in a time, when uniformity in worſhip according to the Word, was about to have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Magiſtrate in the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> hindered that good work: 'tis very probable, that <hi>reformation</hi> had been much forwarded in our Churches at this day, and many of our civil ſhakings and overturnings prevented thereby. Your comparing of thoſe, that comply not with your opinion, in matter of Church-State and Government, to the Idolatrous <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and loading them with the opprobrious name of <hi>chriſtened Gentiles,</hi> is very devoid of modeſty and truth. Many Church-guides in our Congregations are as free from the leaſt taint of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> as any of your way. And for the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Churches, who have been baptized in them, and owne their Baptiſme, though the moſt of them do not appear to bee <hi>godly,</hi> yet they differ very much from <hi>Heathens,</hi> being taken into an external <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, and in the number of thoſe that are <hi>called;</hi> And are as much the <hi>people of God,</hi> as ſometime formal and prophane <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were; the eſtate of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at this day, to whom the ordinances are given, being not inferiour to that of <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. And therefore as the Infants of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had generally right to <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> So have the children of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, owning their Baptiſme (though corrupt in their converſation,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118995:14"/> but promiſing reformation) right to <hi>Baptiſme.</hi> Elſe were the grace of God <hi>ſtreighter</hi> under the Goſpel, than before Chriſt was exhibited in the fleſh, which cannot bee.</p>
               <p>But you have this more againſt our Churches, that <hi>men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed hearts ſtand ſeized of the power of the keyes</hi> in them, becauſe the major part are ſuch in our Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petitio principij!</hi> As if the <hi>people</hi> had the <hi>power of the keyes</hi> committed to them; you know wee owne not that <hi>doctrine.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Church-guides,</hi> have the power of the keyes committed to them, and many of ſuch among us, are to bee reputed <hi>godly.</hi> And, if in moſt places, <hi>wicked</hi> men ſtand ſeized of the power of the Keyes, yet this will not ſerve to juſtifie ſeparation from our Churches, as falſe and Antichriſtian.

               <p>Your <hi>prudential</hi> conſideration for <hi>ſeparation,</hi> 
                  <q>That there is no probability of reforming our Churches,<note place="margin">P. 20, 21, 22</note> becauſe the greateſt part in them are wicked, and will hinder the work;</q> which you ſtrengthen with a paſſage, out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Little Stone;</hi> Is certainly an argument which the <hi>Prophets</hi> and holy people of God, in the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were not acquainted with, or thought not to bee of <hi>force,</hi> to warrant them to ſeparate, or to neglect indeavours for reformation.

               <p>My apprehenſions of the <hi>witneſſes,</hi> according to Scripture, are theſe.

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:118995:16"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 3, 5. And the former part of the ſixth allude to <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who witneſſed againſt the Apoſtacy, and Idolatry of their times, and more particularly to <hi>Elias,</hi> who deſtroyed his enemies by <hi>fire,</hi> and did, by his <hi>prayers, open and ſhut Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. <hi>James</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. the latter part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who did <hi>turne the waters to blood,</hi> and did <hi>ſmite the Egyptian earth with all Plagues,</hi> Exod. 7.</p>
               <p>Now it is obſervable, 1 That in <hi>two</hi> of theſe three paire of types, one beares the perſon of a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> the other of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Prophet.

But in no age, have <hi>Prophets</hi> been wanting to this office and work, whereas, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> appear in it, at ſome times onely; as, 1 In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>reformation,</hi> in a Land or Nation, as <hi>Moſes</hi> appeared with <hi>Aaron.</hi> when the people were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſerve the Lord; and <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> appears with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>reformation,</hi> after the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity.</p>

                  <hi>meaning of Churches</hi> jure divino; and (ſpeaking of the Churches of <hi>England;) All the work now is, not to make them Churches, which were none before, but to reduce, and reſtore them to their primitive Inſtitution.</hi> Your ſelf, do not deny our Pariſh-Churches, to bee the ſucceſſors of the Churches planted here, by the mentioned worthies; and on that account one would think, <hi>reformation</hi> ſhould ſerve your turne, without riſing ſo high as <hi>ſeparation.</hi> But this you think will beare you out, that they <hi>do not imitate the conſtitution, nor converſation of thoſe firſt Churches.</hi> If you ſhould go about to prove either part of this <hi>aſſertion</hi> (which you wiſely forbeare to do) you would finde a hard task of it; Becauſe it is not poſſible, you ſhould certainly know, what was the <hi>conſtitution</hi> or <hi>converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of thoſe firſt Churches. But I ſhall grant, and do beleeve, <hi>ours</hi> do not generally imitate their <hi>converſation,</hi> being more corrupted in manners, through the neglect of <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> And what then? doth the Scripture any where teach you, that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in <hi>manners,</hi> yea in many regards in <hi>adminiſtration,</hi> and uſe of ordinances, whilſt the fundamentals, and eſſentials are retained, in doctrine and worſhip, is a ſufficient ground for <hi>Separation?</hi> I provoke you to make that appear. And indeed this is the point, that you <hi>Separatiſts</hi> ſtand bound to make good, and which if you cannot (as I am ſure you cannot from the Word) all your declamations againſt our Churches, will not a whit free you from the guilt of <hi>Schiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the other branch, of <hi>not imitating their conſtitution,</hi> 'tis a charge, as weakly bottomed, and inferring as the other. For, the particular conſtitution of thoſe Churches, is, as I have ſaid, <hi>unknown</hi> to you, and our Churches, are not now newly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting,</hi> but have been long <hi>conſtituted,</hi> and are ſucceſſors of thoſe firſt Churches. And no more unchurched, and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to bee newly conſtituted, by the intervention of <hi>Papal</hi> corruptions, then the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, by the intervention of heatheniſh <hi>Idolatries</hi> in it, during the reign of bad Kings. And that way of <hi>conſtitution,</hi> ſtill holds our Churches in their State, which gave and maintained an eccleſiaſtical being, to the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Churches, even the profeſſing and owning of the doctrines of the Goſpel in them, and the aſſociating under
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118995:17"/> Paſtors, for the uſe of Ordinances. Which, though defective among us, in ſome points that concern the <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> yet are ſo far found, as ſuffice to maintain the <hi>eſſe</hi> of our Churches. So that notwithſtanding your prohibiting us, to account your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial preſſing of the caſting out of Pariſh-Churches, <hi>harſh:</hi> it is, and muſt bee looked upon by us, as very <hi>harſh, arrogant, unjuſt,</hi> and <hi>unchriſtian;</hi> having no ground in reaſon, nor ground or example in Scripture, to countenance it.</p>
               <p>The Text you here build upon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.4 for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your <hi>excommunicating</hi> ſentence, paſt upon all <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> that are not of your way, maketh not at all for you, but much againſt you (as hath been in part ſhewed;) for,</p>

                  <q>WEe come now, in the ſecond place, to interpret Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, by Epiſcopal Churches, that are, the greater territories, formed into Dioceſan, Provincial, and Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Churches, under the ſeveral orders of Biſhops.</q>

                  <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> of the kind you mention, being now diſcharged among us, you might have ſpared your reader, about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Let thoſe that would ſee, what is ſaid for and againſt that Government, read the treatiſes of learned men on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. I ſhall onely, here ſay to you in general, that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in <hi>Church-Government</hi> is no ſufficient cauſe for ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from a Church. <hi>Wee muſt not</hi> (ſay you, p. 52.) <hi>for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a right faith, ſwallow a wrong order.</hi> And wee muſt not, (ſay I) becauſe of ſome corruptions in the form of Church-Government, forſake communion with a Church, profeſſing the true faith. Your aſſertion, in your <hi>ſenſe,</hi> ſtands onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own authority. Mine ſtands in the very light of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle John,</hi> in his third <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> mentions a great <hi>corruption in Church-Government,</hi> but giveth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, any precept for, or encouragement to <hi>ſeparation.</hi> There were great corruptions crept into the form of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in Chriſts time; The Lord had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that there ſhould bee onely <hi>one High-Prieſt</hi> at a time, and hee was to continue in his office during <hi>life;</hi> But there were then <hi>two</hi> High-Prieſts together, that acted in the function, each his year ſucceſſively, <hi>John</hi> 11.47, 49. Beſides, the High-<hi>Prieſthood,</hi> was at that time bought for mony, procured by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at the hands of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Multitudes of corruptions there were alſo in the Prieſts actings, &amp;c. Yet, the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives no command, or intimation to his Diſciples, to <hi>ſeparate</hi> from them, as from a <hi>falſe Church;</hi> but onely bids them take heed of being <hi>leavened</hi> with their corrupt <hi>doctrines,</hi> and drawn to an imitation of their wicked actions. And the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf held communion with them, as a true Church, in his life time.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Here, indeed, is the <hi>Hinge</hi> of the Controverſies, between us and our Reverend Brethren of the <hi>Congregational</hi> way, in Old and New-<hi>England,</hi> who ſtand to their firſt profeſſed principles; owning our Congregations as <hi>true Churches,</hi> but ſcrupling the Government of them by their <hi>Guides united,</hi> confining all power of Government, to a <hi>ſingle Congregation,</hi> and contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it ought to bee ſo, with all Goſpel-Churches. Had Mr. <hi>P.</hi> been <hi>ſuch a one,</hi> I ſhould more gladly have entred the liſts with him than I do. But hee hath much out-grown his Brethren in <hi>Scruples,</hi> and nothing will ſatisfie him concerning our Churches, but what the <hi>Edomites</hi> wiſh'd againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> even the <hi>raſing of them to the foundation thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our parts, wee beleeve that Goſpel Churches <hi>may,</hi> and commonly <hi>ought</hi> to conſiſt of <hi>divers ſingle Congregations,</hi> united under, and governed by their Elders in common; and that wee have <hi>primitive examples</hi> for it; and among them, in the firſt and chief place, that of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Apoſtles times, which is that, that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> inſtanceth in, to eſtabliſh the contrary opinion.</p>
               <p>Before I enter upon the diſpute, I deſire it may bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the enquiry is not, of what number of members a Church conſiſted, when it began <hi>firſt</hi> to bee planted: But, the inquiry is, how it was with Churches, when arrived to <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>maturity,</hi> during the times in which the Apoſtles lived.</p>
               <p>This premiſed, I begin with the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſay, that the <hi>Church of Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Of the Church of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</note> when it grew numerous enough for it, <hi>conſiſted of divers ſingle Congregations, as of ſo many parts, making up one intire and compleat Church.</hi> For proof
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118995:20"/> whereof, let it bee conſidered, that,</p>
               <p n="1">1 There was a Church at <hi>Jeruſalem, before</hi> the addition of the firſt three thouſand, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. And the members of the Church at that time, cannot bee conceived to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined within the limits of <hi>one</hi> ſingle Congregation. For the Miniſtery of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was exceeding ſucceſſeful, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.31. <hi>John</hi> 2.23. <hi>John</hi> 12.19. It is ſaid of <hi>John, Matth.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and all Judea, and all the Region round about Jordan, went out to him, and were baptized of him.</hi> And yet, of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>hee made and baptized more diſciples than John,</hi> John 4.1. <hi>Viſibly</hi> more, ſo that the Phariſees could take notice of it. Unto theſe converted by <hi>Johns</hi> and Chriſts Miniſtery, add thoſe brought in by the Miniſtery of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſeventy <hi>Diſciples,</hi> whom Chriſt endued with a power to work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that thereby they might gain faith to their doctrine, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. and yet, ſtill there is <hi>great want of labourers, the Harveſt was ſo great,</hi> Luk. 10.2. and beſides theſe, <hi>more</hi> are found (not without Chriſts approbation) labouring in his Vineyard, impowered alſo to work miracles, to confirme Chriſts doctrine which they taught, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.38, 39. and of thoſe there ſeem to have been <hi>many,</hi> Matth. 7.22. Now, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Brethren will not grant, that by <hi>Baptiſme</hi> men are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into any other, than a <hi>particular Church,</hi> and there is no mention in Scripture of any other particular Church; till long after this time, but that of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> onely: Let them from the premiſes judge, whether the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> even <hi>before</hi> the addition of the firſt three thouſand, muſt not needs conſiſt of more Congregations than <hi>one.</hi> But ſuppoſing, that as yet there might bee but <hi>one</hi> Congregation in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet when wee conſider, from the Texts Mr. <hi>P.</hi> quotes, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>three thouſand,</hi> and of <hi>five thouſand</hi> more, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of <hi>multitudes,</hi> and adde hereunto, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.1.7. and 12.24. which ſpeak of the farther prevailing of the Word, and great <hi>increaſe</hi> of the number of the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and together there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:118995:20"/>2 There was a great number of <hi>labourers,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> There were at firſt the twelve <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and one hundred and eight <hi>Diſciples</hi> (and moſt likely 'tis, there were more afterwards) men of rare abilities, and extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, all whoſe labours cannot well be imagined to have been ſpent in the ſervice of <hi>one</hi> ſingle Congregation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The <hi>time,</hi> when there was a full imployment for ſo many labourers was the firſt year after Chriſts Aſcention, and 'tis likely 'twas early in that year; for in the ſecond year <hi>Paul</hi> was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereupon the perſecution begun at <hi>Stephens</hi> death ſlacked, and the Churches were multiplied, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. Now, many more might bee brought in by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> during the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, for they <hi>abode at Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 8.1. And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>in Jeruſalem</hi> divers years after the perſecution was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2. this Council being held about ſeventeen years after Chriſts Aſcention.

               <p n="4">4 At this time there were <hi>divers languages</hi> ſpoken in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> by perſons dwelling there, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.5. ſixteen ſeveral lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages are reckoned up, <hi>verſe</hi> 9, 10, 11. Now, many of theſe perſons being converted to the profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, Reaſon teacheth us to apprehend, that they were diſtributed into <hi>ſeveral Congregations,</hi> according to their ſeveral languages, to have in them the myſteries of the Goſpel preach't unto them, for their edification in the faith of Chriſt. For which cauſe, and that ſome of them might preach unto ſtrange Nations, Chriſt poured out the gift of <hi>tongues</hi> on the twelve Apoſtles, and one hundred and eight Diſciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.8.15. with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations prevaile with mee to conclude, that in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there were <hi>divers Congregations,</hi> under ſeveral Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and yet all making up but one compleat Church. All theſe ſeveral Congregations, being called in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>the Church of Jeruſalem.</hi> This inſtance is granted, by the learned Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>It doth not appear, that (ſetting aſide the Church of Jeruſalem) they</hi> (the Chriſtians of one Church) <hi>ſhould needs meet in ſeveral places.</hi>

               <p>But, becauſe your ſelf and others much deny this of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that if this inſtance bee made good, the cauſe is ours, in the point of <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Churches, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divers Congregations; I ſhall anſwer the <hi>Objections</hi> made by you, and others.</p>
               <p>Object. 1 <hi>The three thouſand,</hi> Act. 2.41. (ſay the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Authors of the <hi>defence of the nine poſitions,</hi> p. 125.) <hi>were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the one hundred and twenty.

               <p n="2">2 Either theſe were added <hi>before</hi> the three thouſand, or <hi>not at all,</hi> for ought appears from Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That there were at this time, many more beleevers of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem, before</hi> the hundred and twenty, is to mee out of doubt. <hi>Chriſt appears to above five hundred Brethren at once,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. Theſe may be conceived, embodied brethren of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> met together in the exerciſe of the duties of Gods worſhip, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.33, 36. and a part of thoſe converted by <hi>John, Christ, the Apoſtles, &amp;c.</hi> And I am of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that Chriſt, during his forty daies converſe with his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> Act. 1.3. <hi>ſpeaking of the things pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> gave them directions for his worſhip, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church; and that during that time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the miſſion of the holy Ghoſt, on the day of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, by Chriſts direction, caſt Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a certain <hi>Goſpel-order</hi> (which, poſſibly till now they were not fixt in) for the uſe of all the Ordinances of Chriſt, in ſeveral ſocieties, under their proper officers; and that theſe made up the <hi>Church of Jeruſalem,</hi> to which the three thouſand <hi>were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> to ſhare in thoſe priviledges, which the reſt enjoyed before, which is implied, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The <hi>hundred and twenty</hi> were onely the <hi>Guides</hi> of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118995:21"/> Church, their number is made up, of the <hi>twelve Apoſtles, ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Diſciples,</hi> and <hi>thirty eight Perſons</hi> more, all of Chriſts reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue whilſt hee was on earth, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15, 21. The Apoſtles, and ſeventy Diſciples, were, wee read in the Goſpel, made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by Chriſt; and the other thirty eight, cannot well bee looked upon as <hi>no Miniſters.</hi> For 1 They converſed, in the ſame ſpecial manner, with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both before, and after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, as the Apoſtles, and ſeventy Diſciples did, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.21, 22. 2 Any one of the thirty eight was in as neer a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to bee made an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in the room of <hi>Judas,</hi> as any of the Seventy; which argueth them to bee men of the <hi>ſame rank,</hi> with the Seventy. 3 All the hundred and twenty, were to <hi>ſtay at Jeruſalem, waiting for the promiſe</hi> of pouring the Holy Ghoſt on them, by which they ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the gift of ſtrange tongues, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4, 5, 13, 14, 15. with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4. 4 From theſe laſt texts, it appeareth, that the whole hundred and twenty, received <hi>the gift of tongues,</hi> on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> the end of which was, to preach the Goſpel to people of divers languages, now in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and hereafter in other Nations. Therefore <hi>all the hundred and twenty were Miniſters,</hi> and the three thouſand were added to the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where they Miniſtred, and <hi>they</hi> were the ſtanding <hi>Presbytery,</hi> the <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of that Church, and not any of them of the <hi>governed:</hi> The multitude of baptized beleevers at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being in all likelihood, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds, if not ſome thouſands; Elſe, what account can bee given, of the ſucceſs of Chriſts Miniſtery in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> mentioned <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. and 4.1. and 7.31. and 8.30. and 11.28, 45. and 12.19?

               <p n="1">1 <hi>Paul</hi> being come to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> giveth an account to <hi>James</hi> and the Elders, of the ſucceſſe of his Miniſtery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> verſ. 18, 19. And they on the other ſide, give <hi>Paul</hi> an account of the hand of God with their Miniſtery at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> verſ. 20. Therefore to thruſt in the Jews of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and other parts, is quite beſides the purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>Jews</hi> are ſuch as it ſeems <hi>Paul</hi> had no account of till now, though hee were the <hi>Apoſtle of the Gentiles,</hi> and had laboured among them many years, and ſo had cauſe to know of them better than any other Apoſtle. Therefore they were <hi>Jews of Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Theſe <hi>Jews</hi> had the charge againſt <hi>Paul</hi> onely by infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from others, verſ. 21. which Argues that they did not live among the Gentiles, for then they would have had perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowledge of his carriage.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe <hi>Jews</hi> are ſuppoſed by the Apoſtles to bee <hi>ſatisfiable</hi> by <hi>Pauls</hi> preſent conformity, verſ. 22, 23, 24. But Jews diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that had heard <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>known</hi> neerly his practice, would not have been thus ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi> could bee none of the number of theſe <hi>myriads of Jews,</hi> for by the matter of their declaiming againſt the Apoſtle, they manifeſt that they had not imbraced the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> But the <hi>Myriads</hi> of Jews ſpoken of are ſaid to be <hi>beleeving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I conclude theſe <hi>Myriads</hi> of Jews did belong to the <hi>Church of Jeruſalem,</hi> and did dwell in or about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt needs conſiſt of

               <p>Theſe two Chapters well weighed, would put an end to divers controverſies among us, about the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the Church. For, 1 Hence Chriſtians might bee convinced, that <hi>Church-power</hi> was never committed to the <hi>people,</hi> but to

                  <hi>Church-officers</hi> only.

The <hi>Elders</hi> in <hi>Pergamos</hi> ſound in the faith, muſt in a diſciplinary way hinder the <hi>Balaamites</hi> and <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> from teaching their errors in the aſſemblies of Chriſtians there. 3 Hence appears that the <hi>ſpirit of the Prophets</hi> is not <hi>ſubject</hi> to the <hi>people,</hi> but to the <hi>Prophets</hi> onely. The <hi>Angel</hi> of each Church, the Church-officers, muſt try the Prophets, and <hi>thoſe that ſay they are Apoſtles,</hi> Rev. 2.2.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider, how Mr. <hi>P.</hi> proceeds.</p>

And when I read ſuch places as theſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>John</hi> 20.22, 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. I cannot without offering violence to my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, imagine that they ſpeak to and of the Community; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering withall, what expreſs charges the Community have upon them from God, to bee <hi>ſubject</hi> to thoſe that are <hi>over them</hi> in the Lord, as to their <hi>Governours, Teachers, Paſtors, Rulers, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will particularly conſider, the firſt of theſe Texts, which is that, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> urgeth for his cauſe, and ſhew how little it makes for it.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17, 18. ſpeaks of the <hi>Church-Officers</hi> onely, doth appear, becauſe it is ſpoken by Chriſt, with reference firſtly, to the <hi>Jewiſh Church-governours,</hi> than which there was then no other governing Church in being. And this is the joint judgement of the Antients, <hi>Ambroſe, Cyril, Theodoret, Gregory, &amp;c.</hi> and of multitudes of later lights in the Church, <hi>Melanchton, Areti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Muſculus, Bucan, Cartwright, Parker, &amp;c.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi> gives a reaſon of it from the words our Saviour uſeth, viz. <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, Heathen,</hi> and that otherwiſe the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> could not have underſtood Chriſt, knowing then <hi>no other</hi> Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So that, the Lord Chriſt manifeſtly alludes to the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,</hi> and gives from it a <hi>pattern</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church. Firſt, the offending brother muſt bee dealt with, in a <hi>private</hi> way; If this prevail not, <hi>one or two witneſſes</hi> are to bee taken, the next time admonition is given; If this work not on him, then the <hi>Church</hi> is to bee told of it, that is, the Elders of the Church, before whom among the <hi>Jews,</hi> Eccleſiaſtical cauſes were brought (firſt the Elders of that particular congregation, then (if need bee) the aſſociated Elders of <hi>combined</hi> Congregations, for ſo among the <hi>Jews</hi> the <hi>Rulers of the Synagogue</hi> were firſt compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118995:28"/> 
                  <hi>binding,</hi> cannot any way bee hence gathered, without offering a manifeſt violence to the Text; which Mr. <hi>P.</hi> doth to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and withall to all rules, both of divine and humane <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> when hee makes not onely the <hi>community</hi> judges and Governours, but even the <hi>offending brother,</hi> a judge in his own cauſe.</p>
               <p>Let us now, draw an <hi>Argument</hi> from this Text, to relieve <hi>Claſſes</hi> againſt his fierce aſſault. If in this place, our Saviour layes down a <hi>rule,</hi> for the healing of <hi>all the grievances</hi> of his Church; then, by the <hi>Church</hi> here to bee complained to, wee muſt underſtand, not onely the Church governing of <hi>one</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but alſo the Church governing of <hi>many</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But in this place, Chriſt laies down a <hi>rule</hi> for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>all the grievances</hi> of his Church; therefore, wee muſt by the <hi>Church</hi> here underſtand, the Church governing, even of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Congregations, or the <hi>united Elders</hi> of <hi>ſeveral</hi> Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Churches. The <hi>minor</hi> is clear, becauſe this is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>expreſs</hi> Text, wherein Chriſt did lay down a <hi>rule</hi> to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for the <hi>healing of offences</hi> in his Church; and I ſuppoſe none will ſay, that Chriſts <hi>remedy,</hi> is too ſhort to reach the <hi>malady.</hi> The conſequence of the <hi>major</hi> is made out thus. Not onely one Brother may offend another, but the Elders one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one part of the Congregation the other, the Congregation the Elders, the Elders the Congregation, and one or more Churches, one or many Siſter Churches. Our ſad experience proves this to bee a truth, and it is alſo proved by Scripture-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Now, how ſhall ſuch evils bee <hi>healed,</hi> but by an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> and application to a <hi>repreſentative</hi> Church, a Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning ſo <hi>comprehenſive,</hi> as the <hi>caſe</hi> will require? If a Church ſo comprehenſive, be not here meant, then Chriſtian Churches, are in ſuch caſes, left without <hi>remedy;</hi> but that being not to bee granted, it will follow, that the Church governing here ſpoken of, takes into its meaning, an aſſembly or Church of Officers of <hi>many</hi> Congregations.</p>
               <p>Leaving Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to conſider this Argument, I return to the point, the holding of which hee chargeth upon us, as a <hi>crime,</hi> that the <hi>power of the Keyes</hi> belongs onely to the <hi>Elderſhip.</hi> For which, I ſhall cite the ſuffrages of <hi>Congregational</hi> Brethren themſelves. <hi>The Key of authority and rule</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cotton) is committed to the Elders of the Church,</hi>

Again, <hi>the Elders, are Rulers, Governours, have power to command, as ſuperiours in authority judicial. The Church is charged to obey them, not to command, to bee ſubject, not to govern.

                  <q>Secondly, They exclude the ſingle Congregations, conſidered ſeverally, each one by it ſelf, from having an Elderſhip, having power to exerciſe Eccleſiaſtick Diſcipline.<note place="margin">P. 32, 33, 34.</note> But is it likely, that, go tell the Church, ſhould mean, go tell the Elders of the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Wee hold, that the power of Government reſiding in the Elderſhip; a particular Congregation may, and ought to have an appropriate <hi>Elderſhip</hi> belonging to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That a ſingle Congregation having an appropriate Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is a <hi>true Church.</hi>

               <p n="5">5 That the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of a <hi>ſingle</hi> Congregation, have power to end differences among themſelves, in caſes that are <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi>

               <p n="6">6 That in caſes <hi>weighty and extraordinary,</hi> as <hi>excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> The <hi>Presbytery</hi> or Elderſhip of <hi>conſociated</hi> Congregations, are concerned, as well as the Presbytery of that <hi>ſingle</hi> Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, of which the offending Brother is. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth not to the

               <p n="7">7 That there is no example, in all the New Teſtament, of <hi>excommunication,</hi> by the <hi>particular</hi> Elderſhip of one <hi>ſingle</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p n="8">8 That therefore a <hi>ſingle</hi> Congregation, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> is not a <hi>compleat, entire Church,</hi> furniſhed with full power, for <hi>all</hi> acts of Church-diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="9">9 That wee finde in the New Teſtament, <hi>Church-Diſcipline</hi> commonly executed, in a <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Church, conſiſting of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Congregations. Such was the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the Elderſhip of this Church, as ſuch, did commonly exerciſe <hi>Church-Diſcipline, tryed falſe Prophets,</hi> and thoſe that called themſelves <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and convicted them as <hi>lyars,</hi> Rev. 2.

               <p n="10">10 That in <hi>extraordinary</hi> caſes, wee have an example of <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> from <hi>one Presbyterial</hi> Church, to an <hi>aſſociation</hi> of ſuch Churches to guide us. The Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> (and probably alſo thoſe of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Silicia,</hi> Act. 15.23.) appeals, to an <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles and Elders at Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Elders of that Church</hi> united; (probably alſo of the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia</hi>) and the controverſie, which could not bee ended otherwiſe, is ended in and by that <hi>Synod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, <hi>larger</hi> Synods and <hi>Councils</hi> may bee <hi>neceſſary,</hi> even an <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> to heal publick and ſpreading evils. <hi>If the Church</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cotton) where the offence lyeth,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Hence, you may rectifie your <hi>miſtakes;</hi> wee exclude not the Elderſhip of a <hi>ſingle</hi> Congregation, from power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſay, it hath not <hi>ordinarily</hi> power for <hi>all</hi> acts of Church-Diſcipline.

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:118995:30"/>
               <p>What you ſay of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> helps you not, for it hath been evinced, that they were not <hi>ſingle</hi> Congregations.</p>
               <p>What you adde, againſt <hi>higher Elderſhips, or larger combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Churches than thoſe of the firſt ſtep from ſingle Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> from the conſideration of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> doth you no ſervice, but <hi>è contra.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1 By granting the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> to have been <hi>collective Churches,</hi> you pull down what you had ſaid, for the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationalneſs of</hi> Churches. Grant them <hi>collective</hi> Churches, and the greateſt part of your book is <hi>una litura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 By ſaying, that it <hi>appears not from Scripture, that there are any larger combinations of Churches, than thoſe of this firſt form;</hi> You look beſide the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the ſtate of the <hi>Queſtion.</hi> The ſtate of the queſtion; becauſe wee ſtand not for <hi>ſtated</hi> and <hi>fixed</hi> combinations of Churches, beyond that <hi>firſt form,</hi> but onely <hi>occaſional</hi> ones; and the Scripture, becauſe as hath been, and ſhall bee ſhewed, there was a <hi>higher</hi> Elderſhip, and <hi>larger</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of Churches in the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> than <hi>thoſe of the firſt ſtep from ſingle congregations:</hi> the <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial</hi> Churches of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, and in all probability, thoſe alſo of <hi>Syria and Cilicia,</hi> as hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If you will <hi>ſtand</hi> to what you ſay, that <hi>the Churches of</hi> Aſia, <hi>do ſeverally receive praiſe or diſpraiſe, each for her ſelf, without reflection on the reſt;</hi> I will compel you to grant <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> (and not onely <hi>ſuppoſitively</hi>) that they were <hi>collective</hi> Churches. For the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to every one hath this <hi>cloſe, Hee that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> If what Chriſt ſaies to one <hi>Church,</hi> hee ſays to the <hi>Churches,</hi> and yet the <hi>ſeveral</hi> Churches do <hi>each for her ſelf,</hi> reſtrainedly <hi>receive praiſe or diſpraiſe;</hi> It follows unavoidably, that <hi>every one</hi> of the ſeven Churches, was a <hi>collective</hi> Church, and ſo you diſpute againſt, and confute your ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4 'Tis not <hi>ſtrange,</hi> as you ſay it is, <hi>that Chriſt ſhould not ſpeak of a combination of theſe ſeven Churches, as an Ordinance of his, for their remedie; and blame them for the neglect of it.</hi> For they were <hi>firſt</hi> to uſe, and Chriſt directs them accordingly to the uſe of, the <hi>firſt</hi> means, the help of the <hi>Presbytery of each Church.</hi> If this would <hi>do,</hi> there was no <hi>need of carrying the cauſe higher;</hi> if upon tryal it would <hi>not do,</hi> they knew what

               </p>
               <p>To your queſtion, Whether <hi>it bee likely, that, go tell the Church, ſhould mean, go tell the Elders of the combination;</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is likely, and it hath been proved to mean ſo; yet not <hi>firſtly,</hi> as you ſeem to inſinuate that wee hold, but <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> when the Elderſhip of the <hi>particular</hi> Church, where the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is given, prevail not to remove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Here was no Synod, <hi>Act. 15.</hi> that is, an aſſembly of Officers, reſulting out of many inferiour Presbyteries.<note place="margin">P. 35. 10 p. 45</note> 
                     <hi>1</hi> Becauſe we read not of any ſuch combination of the Churches there mentioned, to become ſubject to the rule of one Superior Elderſhip. <hi>2</hi> Becauſe wee read of no forreigners, that came to this Synod, but thoſe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who concurred not in the Decrees of it, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the deciſion of the controverſy, <hi>Act. 16.4. 3</hi> Here was no appeal from the cenſure of the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> there paſſed no cenſure, but onely had been a diſſention, and diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo the errand of the Meſſengers was to get ſatisfaction, that the ſame doctrin was taught at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as at <hi>Antioch. 4</hi> Here was no rule exerciſed over the Churches, for it would argue a diminution of <hi>Pauls</hi> Apoſtolical Authority, that the Decrees of the Apoſtles ſhould more than materially bind him. And theſe Decrees are made by a joynt act of the Apostles, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Brethren (difference in the order of their concurrence we grant, but in the nature of the Act wee cannot grant) but it will not bee granted that the Brethren did exerciſe an Act of Rule over other Churches. To ſay, that by the whole Church is meant the Synodical Church, is without ground, being built on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of the meeting of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in one place, which hath been refuted. And if the Brethren were ſhut out from a concurrence of the ſame nature with the Elders, will they ſay, that the Elders of a Claſſical Presbytery at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe rule over all theſe Churches ſo far diſtant, that could not be of their combination?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus, if wee ſhould grant Claſſical Elderſhip, it will bee hard to grant any more with Scripture warrant. But wee ſhall not grant theſe, having proved the moſt numerous Churches to have been Congregational, and called ſeverally by the name of Church
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118995:31"/> in the ſingular, and the numerous Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was not onely Congregational, but had and exerciſed the power of the Keyes. <hi>Paul,</hi> wraps up Elders and people together, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of diſcipline, with a concurrence of the like nature. And thus, the whole fabrick of the Claſſical way falls to the ground.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. P. (as one obſerves) is a man of <hi>growing ſcruples,</hi> and hath much out-ſtript in them, the Reverend <hi>New-England Congregational</hi> Brethren;<note place="margin">Keys chap. 6.</note> and that in weighty points, rejecting <hi>Ruling-Elders,</hi> &amp;c. and here <hi>Synods.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> tells him, that <hi>Synods are an Ordinance of Chriſt,</hi> grounding himſelf on <hi>Act.</hi> 15. ſaying, <hi>'Tis a precedent for ſucceeding Ages.</hi> And that, <hi>they have power by the grace of Chriſt, to command and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the things to bee beleeved and done;</hi> for which hee cites the expreſs words of the <hi>Synodal letter,</hi> verſ. 28. And that <hi>this power to binde burdens, ariſeth not onely materially from the weight of the things impoſed, but formally from the authority of the Synod, as an Ordinance of Chriſt.</hi> Adding, that <hi>the fraternity have onely a power of liberty, not of authority,</hi> for which hee quotes <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4. And <hi>excepts from the power of a Synod, onely the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning of things in their uſe indifferent, not denying them power of Ordination and Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>P.</hi> is an Independent of an <hi>higher form,</hi> Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he ſaith.</p>
               <p n="1">1 His firſt reaſon againſt the <hi>Synodicalneſs</hi> of this Aſſembly, that wee <hi>Read not of a combination of Churches,</hi> is untrue, For, the <hi>deputed Elders</hi> of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> combined with thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and there is no reaſon to exclude thoſe of <hi>the Churches of Syria and Cilicia,</hi> ſince the Decrees reach <hi>them,</hi> and that, not onely the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> but alſo thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, are ſubjected to them. Will Mr. <hi>P.</hi> grant no more, than what hee reads in expreſs words?</p>
               <p n="2">2 His ſecond is as weak, That <hi>we read of no forreigners there, but thoſe of</hi> Antioch, <hi>and that they concurred not in the making of the Decrees.</hi> For, if there were <hi>no more</hi> forreigners, yet forreigners <hi>they</hi> were; but where doth hee read, that the Elders of <hi>Syria and Cilicia</hi> were not joyned to them? There is ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude they <hi>were,</hi> ſince the Decrees reach thoſe Churches. In ſaying, that <hi>theſe forreigners concurred not in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Decrees,</hi> hee ſpeaks clearly beſides the book. For they being <hi>Elders,</hi> and at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> met with the Elders of that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118995:31"/> Church; and hee being ſo punctual in holding no more than he reads in expreſs words; Let him ſee whether he can exclude <hi>them</hi> from thoſe Texts, verſ. 6, 20, 22, 25, 28. <hi>&amp; Act.</hi> 16.4. If the Forreigners were <hi>Elders,</hi> certainly theſe texts <hi>include</hi> them; and 'tis one of the <hi>myſterious</hi> reaches of his wit, to apprehend them <hi>excluded from the deciſion of the controverſy,</hi> by <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4. for were not the <hi>Forreigners</hi> Elders, and were they not at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in <hi>the Aſſembly</hi> at the making of the Decrees? how then doth this text <hi>exclude</hi> them?</p>
               <p n="3">3 His third is frivolous; That <hi>there was no appeal from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Church at</hi> Antioch. Grant there had paſſed no formal <hi>cenſure</hi> (which is more than hee can prove) might they not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, for the <hi>deciding</hi> of what was debated, and which there could bee no joynt agreement upon? His fancied <hi>main end, of their applying themſelves to the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to get ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that there was the ſame doctrin taught at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>that was at</hi> Antioch; ſheweth that hee looketh on the Chapter, through ſpectacles of <hi>pre-occupation.</hi> Elſe hee would have ſeen that comming about the Queſtion of difference, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. and the Apoſtles and Elders <hi>comming together to conſider of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ver. 6. and <hi>together decreeing and laying a burden upon the Churches concerned,</hi> verſ, 28. muſt needs evince, that the <hi>main end</hi> was, to have the queſtion <hi>authoritatively decided.</hi> The knowing of the <hi>minde,</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of the Church of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> needed not all this work. <hi>Paul</hi> and others might have informed the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> of it before; Any <hi>Meſſengers</hi> ſent might ſoon have certified them of it; Thoſe that came might without ſuch a ſolemn <hi>convening</hi> have been aſſured of it. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> in their Epiſtles ſhew not that they <hi>minded</hi> ſuch an end chiefly in aſſembling. For though they diſown the erroneous Teachers doctrine, and declare that they gave them no incouragement for it (in thoſe words, <hi>To whom wee gave no ſuch commandement,</hi> which is all that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> can build upon) yet they clearly manifeſt, that the end <hi>of their convening</hi> was, upon the hearing the difference in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to <hi>decide</hi> the Queſtion <hi>authoritatively;</hi> and that the end of ſending choſen men with <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> was to give them the greater aſſurance of this <hi>deciſion,</hi> as the dependance of the 28. verſ. on the 27. by the illative, <hi>for,</hi> doth clearly ſhew.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:118995:32"/>4 His fourth, is a huddle of groundleſſe ſurmiſes. <hi>Here was</hi> (hee ſaith) <hi>no Rule exerciſed, becauſe 'twould bee a diminution of</hi> Pauls <hi>Apoſtolical Authority.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> acted not then, as an <hi>Apostle,</hi> but as an <hi>Elder</hi> of the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi> When the <hi>Elders</hi> there could not prevail againſt the corrupt Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and their Doctrin, they have recourſe to a <hi>Synod,</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves as <hi>Elders,</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> giving herein an example of the right way of healing Church-diviſions, (that cannot bee remedied in the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive Churches) to the end of the world. The <hi>Apostles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acted not meerly as <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but as <hi>members of the Synod,</hi> yielding to a fair diſpute on both ſides.</p>
               <p>Next hee ſaith, <hi>The Brethren concurred with the Apoſtles and Elders in making the Decrees, therefore there was no rule exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, for it will not bee granted (by us) that the Brethren can exerciſe an act of rule over other Churches.</hi> I Anſwer, no nor over their own Church neither; But it is but ſuppoſed by him, that the Brethren <hi>out of office,</hi> concurred in making the Decrees. They <hi>conſented</hi> to the making of them, or to them made, and might uſe their <hi>power of Liberty,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ſpeaks, but concurred not in the <hi>act of making</hi> them, for if ſo, they had been <hi>their Decrees,</hi> but they are not ſo called, but expreſly otherwiſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4. Much leſſe can wee conceive with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> that <hi>the Brethren concurred with the Elders, in a way of the ſame nature,</hi> aſſigning the <hi>difference</hi> to bee onely in the <hi>order of their concurrence.</hi> For hence it follows, that <hi>all</hi> in the Church are <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>guides,</hi> and have the <hi>Key of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and binding power, which is another <hi>abſurd</hi> attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein hee goes beyond many of his brethren, and the vanity of which hath been already obſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The whole Church here cannot,</hi> hee ſaith, <hi>mean the Synodical Church onely, becauſe the reaſon given for it, the impoſſibility of the meeting of the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>together in one place, hath been refuted by him.</hi> The Reader may look back, and ſee what cauſe hee hath to boaſt; and if his triumph bee but imaginary, then hee hath brought in an argument againſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>But you muſt not think, that <hi>if he do ſhut out the Brethren from a concurrence of the ſame nature with the Elders,</hi> hee hath not ſtrength enough left <hi>him to prove, that in this Aſſembly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118995:32"/> there was no Rule exerciſed;</hi> and for that hee will but caſt an <hi>interrogation</hi> at us. <hi>Will they ſay that the Elders of a Claſſical Presbytery at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>did exerciſe Rule over all theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo far diſtant, and not of their combination?</hi> This being the <hi>Tail</hi> of his arguing, a <hi>ſting</hi> might bee feared in it, but 'tis quite <hi>unarmed.</hi> Wee will not ſay ſo, and yet, hee gets not any thing by it; for though wee ſay not, that the Elders of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem, ſingly</hi> conſidered, did <hi>exerciſe Rule</hi> over the Churches concerned: yet wee will ſay, by his leave, that <hi>theſe Elders, and the Elders of the Churches concerned, united in Synod, and acting joyntly, did exerciſe Rule over thoſe Churches;</hi> which appears both by the tenour, and by the uſe of the Decrees, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4.</p>
               <p>So that, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> is more <hi>bountiful,</hi> than maketh for the <hi>profit of his cauſe,</hi> in <hi>granting</hi> his adverſaries, <hi>to make the moſt of,</hi> Act. 15.6. and <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4. For beſides, that in theſe wee finde not the Elders of the Churches concerned <hi>excluded,</hi> but <hi>included,</hi> and as one; in the latter, wee finde the Decrees <hi>impoſed</hi> on ſome of the Churches concerned, <hi>as ordained of the Apoſtles and the Elders which were at</hi> Jeruſalem, at the time of the making of them, none excepted, and therefore, their <hi>joint-act</hi> of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and rule.</p>
               <p>Hee hath now but an anſwer to an Objection left him, and therein hee comes off worſt of all. For, to that which is ſaid, for the <hi>exerciſe of authority</hi> by this meeting over the Churches (and accounted an unanſwerable argument by moſt, and which if hee remove not, all his talk againſt that <hi>Synod</hi> is to no purpoſe) that the 28th. <hi>verſ.</hi> calleth the Apoſtles and Elders Decrees, the <hi>laying a burden, of neceſſary things,</hi> upon the Churches: Hee onely ſaies, <hi>Let it bee conſidered, whether there be not as much ſaid of the aſſertion of the Phariſees,</hi> verſ. 5. and 10. Which, <hi>Gerſom Bucer's</hi> anſwer, in another caſe, will ſuit well; <hi>Quis adeo ineptire ſuſtinuerit?</hi> Who can chuſe but wonder at his <hi>weakneſs,</hi> to put forth ſuch a reaſoning as an <hi>argument?</hi> and at his <hi>confidence,</hi> to undertake a debate of that moment, as is that which hee is upon, whilſt hee appears, ſo much a ſtranger to the Laws of a true <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> and reaſoning? <hi>If ſome of the Sect of the Phariſees, contending for the neceſſity of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and keeping the Ceremonial Law, are ſaid, thereby, (tempting God) to put a yoak of Jewiſh bondage upon the neck of beleevers,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118995:33"/> and this their impoſition, was not authoritatively binding; Then, when the Apostles and Elders ſay, that they lay by their Decrees, a burden of neceſſary things upon the Churches, their Decrees, are not to be accounted authoritatively binding. But ſome of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, &amp;c.</hi> Ergo. This is his ſad arguing, of the <hi>deplorableneſs</hi> of which, I need not any farther inform any intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>But, there is nothing like a <hi>good courage,</hi> and therefore hee concludes (bee it how it may) <hi>Thus you ſee, how hard it will be, to grant any more with Scripture warrant, if we ſhould grant Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Elderſhips and combinations.</hi> Which difficulty, I ſuppoſe, thoſe that have conſidered what hath been ſaid, do not <hi>ſee at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, leſt men ſhould take his <hi>Suppoſition</hi> of Claſſical Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips for a <hi>grant,</hi> hee now returns to renounce them, and tells us, 1 <hi>That hee hath proved the moſt numerous Churches to have been congregational;</hi> To which I anſwer, I have diſproved it. 2 <hi>That they are called ſeverally by the name of Church in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> (that is <hi>alwaies,</hi> or elſe hee ſaies nothing) Witneſs, ſay I, the <hi>ſeven Churches of</hi> Aſia, concerning <hi>each</hi> of which his words have been made to grant, that <hi>it is ſaid, without reference to, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the rest, hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi> 3 <hi>That the numerous Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>in particular, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational.</hi> To which I ſay, witneſs 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Let your Women keep ſilence in the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What hee ſubjoyns, that <hi>the body of that Church did exerciſe the power of the Keyes, and that the Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. <hi>wraps up Elders and People together with a concurrence of the like nature,</hi> is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> as hath been ſhewed. I ſhall adde, Though the Apoſtle there mention no expreſs <hi>limitation</hi> of the <hi>power of the Keyes</hi> to the <hi>Elderſhip,</hi> it follows not that it is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, for to whom ſhould <hi>acts of rule be appropriated,</hi> but to the <hi>Rulers?</hi> A concurrence with them may be granted to the <hi>community,</hi> in the uſe of their <hi>power of liberty</hi> (as they ſpeak) but a concurrence with them in the thing, <hi>of the like nature</hi> with the power and acts of the <hi>Elders,</hi> hee will never prove, till hee hath proved, that <hi>all</hi> are <hi>Rulers</hi> in the Church, and have a <hi>power of Office,</hi> which hee will do <hi>ad Graecas calendas.</hi> And, if the Apoſtles <hi>ſilence</hi> there, concerning the appropriation of the power of exerciſing Diſcipline to the <hi>Elderſhip,</hi> bee an argument

For, under the notion of <hi>Independentiſm</hi> (of that degree as his is eſpecially) may any thing ſhelter it ſelf; and therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Factors uſually ſay, that in <hi>England, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterianiſm</hi> is a great <hi>hinderance,</hi> but <hi>Independentiſm</hi> a wonderful <hi>help</hi> to them, in their gaining Proſelytes to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>

The people ſtood amazed at this report, and when Sermon was ended, the</hi> Praetor <hi>of the place enquired of the Preacher, in what families or houſes the plague was broken forth; who anſwered, whether the plague bee in our Town or not, ſo I found it it in my Poſtil.</hi> Such an account is Mr. <hi>P.</hi> able to give, of Mr. <hi>Bains</hi> his conſent with him in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Presbytery and Epiſcopacy together, as having no <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> between them in their conſtitution; Whether the words of the Objection which put them together, bee Mr. <hi>Bains</hi> words, or expreſs his mind or not, <hi>hee found them printed in his book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, becauſe Mr. <hi>P.</hi> by mentioning thus Mr. <hi>Bains,</hi> doth intimate to the Reader that his doctrine hath a full <hi>friend</hi> in him; It is to bee conſidered, that though Mr. <hi>Bains</hi> in his diſpute againſt, and oppoſition to <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Epiſcopal Churches, doth plead for <hi>Independency</hi> of Churches: yet as hee judged the <hi>difference</hi> between Epiſcopacy, and Presbyterial dependent Government very great: So doth hee fully declare againſt that <hi>Democratical</hi> Government in Churches, which moſt of the Independents of our daies, and Mr. <hi>P.</hi> among them, do plead for; and doth very fully aſſert the whole power of Government, into the hands of the <hi>Elders,</hi> in many places of that book.

Such was the Congregation in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, which Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> mentions; and thoſe hundred perſons which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (Congr. Way cleared <hi>p. 4.</hi>) that were in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> days. <hi>1576.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>'Tis one thing for Churches to bee looked upon as Churches, in point of ſalvation, another thing, for them to bee looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Churches, in reſpect of outward conſtitution; in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer account, wee cannot but give the right hand of fellowſhip, to all that look to no other way of ſalvation, but by the blood of the Lambe; in the latter account, wee can give the right hand of fellowſhip, onely to thoſe that are after the heavenly pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hee needed not to ſay, that his way nulls <hi>at leaſt</hi> the moſt part of the reformed Churches, for it clearly nulls them <hi>all;</hi> The Churches of his way and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, being not to bee numbered among the <hi>Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> ſince they renounce them, and account them <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.</hi> So that his way clearly nulls <hi>all</hi> the reformed Churches in the world at this day; yea generally, <hi>all</hi> the Churches that have diſowned the Papal Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> throughout the ages ſince the riſe of it.</p>
               <p>His Anſwer, whereby hee would <hi>ſalve</hi> the matter, is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frivolous and childiſh. <hi>Hee denies not the faith of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in reformed Churches, nor their myſtical Churchdome.</hi> But what is that to the purpoſe? whilſt hee denies them to be <hi>Churches of Chriſt,</hi> and to bee the <hi>candleſticks that ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of the earth</hi> (by which hee weakly underſtands Churches, of which Sect. 4.) doth hee not <hi>utterly</hi> null them as Churches? Neither will that paſſage ſhield him (wherein hee clearly contradicts himſelf) that <hi>'tis one thing for Churches
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118995:36"/> to bee looked upon as Churches, in point of ſalvation, another, to bee looked upon as Churches in reſpect of outward conſtitution, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if they are not to bee looked upon as Churches in reſpect of <hi>outward conſtitution,</hi> they are not to bee looked upon as Churches at <hi>all;</hi> unleſs hee can make it appear, that <hi>beleevers out of Church-order,</hi> make up <hi>Churches,</hi> and that there are <hi>many myſtical Churches.</hi> And if reformed Churches are to be looked upon as <hi>Churches in point of ſalvation, they looking to no other way of ſalvation but by the bloud of the Lamb,</hi> and he can give <hi>the right hand of fellowſhip</hi> to them on that account; hee thereby aſſerts their <hi>Churchſtate,</hi> and ſeparates practically from them, therefore, without ſufficient ground. For if they are <hi>Churches</hi> in point of ſalvation, they have the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of <hi>Church-order,</hi> and are not to bee ſeparated from. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> would not have ſeparated from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> if they could have looked upon her (eſpecially after the Sanctions of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council) as a <hi>Church in point of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, looking to no other way of ſalvation but by the blood of the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that notwithſtanding his diſtinctions, Mr. <hi>P's</hi> doctrine doth abſolutely <hi>null all the Reformed Churches,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that have diſowned Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> from the riſe of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to this laſt age; And thereby denyeth that there hath been a <hi>true Miniſtery,</hi> and a <hi>true Church-ſtate,</hi> during many hundreds of years ſince Chriſt, in the world. Directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1, 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1, 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.21.</p>
               <p>To the inſtances which hee brings, of Churches of his way, uſhering them in with a boaſt of their <hi>ſetting up Chriſts order, in the face, and to the teeth of the beast, though in danger to bee ſlain for it;</hi> I Anſwer, that ſurely the <hi>Congregational</hi> Brethren of <hi>our daies,</hi> have not waded through ſuch great <hi>dangers</hi> in contending for, and ſetting up their popular government. They have had, and have, as much countenance from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Powers, as they can deſire. On which account many have ſtruck in with <hi>Independency,</hi> to bee of the riſing ſide. (Surely there are ſome whom they know, that have out-gone them in ſufferings, for cleaving to their principles) and whilſt the Powers did oppoſe their way heretofore, flying to <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:118995:37"/> and <hi>Holland,</hi> was not a ſetting up of the order which they deemed to bee Chriſt's, <hi>in the face, and to the teeth of the Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to his inſtances. I ſuppoſe that Congregation in Queen <hi>Marie's</hi> daies, to have conſiſted of holy perſons, but cannot from the relation that Hiſtory gives us of it, ſee upon what grounds hee preſumes them to have been a party of his <hi>own way,</hi> in point of order and government. Mr. <hi>Bentham</hi> their laſt Miniſter, is there ſaid to have been ſoon after, Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and therefore in all probability no <hi>Independent.</hi> As to the hundred perſons in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies, which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> mentions, I ſhould have liked their witneſſing againſt the corruptions in the Church, ſo far forth as their call would bear them out: but if they ſeparated from the Congregations in <hi>England</hi> in general, as <hi>no true Churches,</hi> no man is able to prove their ſeparation lawful by the word of God; and the words of the ſame Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> pag. 14. of that book, will condemn them, where hee ſaith, Mr. <hi>Robinſons denial of the Pariſhional Congregations in</hi> England <hi>to bee true Churches, was never received into any heart, from thence to infer a nullity of their Church-ſtate; Neither was our departure from them, even in thoſe evil times, a ſeparation from them as no Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, grant theſe two companies to have been <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi> Churches; yet, if they ſeparated from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>no true Churches,</hi> they were in Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> judgement, ſo farre in an errour; and much more is Mr. <hi>P.</hi> for <hi>nulling all</hi> the reformed Churches in the world, whereby he maketh his <hi>Independentiſm</hi> to become <hi>Donatiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee addeth to juſtify himſelf, <q>Wee muſt not for reſpect to a right faith, ſwallow a wrong Order; hath not the letting go the right Order,<note place="margin">p. 52.</note> let in a wrong faith?</q> Yes, it hath indeed by thoſe of your way moſt evidently. For whereas the word of God placeth moſt evidently the power of Church-government in the <hi>Officers</hi> of the Church, as hath been above proved: your <hi>letting go</hi> this Goſpel-<hi>Order,</hi> and bringing in the room of it a phantaſtick <hi>Democratical</hi> government, ſtrange to the word of God, hath <hi>let in a wrong faith</hi> with a witneſſe; for at this back door have entered all the rabble of <hi>Sectaries, Anabaptiſts</hi> (now generally at leaſt ſemi-Papiſts) <hi>Seekers, Quakers,</hi> and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118995:37"/> 
                  <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-men</hi> of the laſt edition, enemies to Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Miniſterial power, as their ſeditious Pamphlets, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and practices, tending to imbrew the State in blood, and Church in confuſion, do witneſs.</p>
               <p>Object. 2 <q>It will be ſaid, this laies a ground to queſtion all the Ordinances, that have been administered in any other way,<note place="margin">P. 52. to 55</note> than that which you preſs for, whether they are to be counted null and void. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some Ordinances have been corrupted in the eſſentials of them, as the Lords Supper in the Popiſh-Churches, and when ſo, they become no Ordinances, and of no efficacy. Others were circumſtantially corrupted onely, as Baptiſm, and when ſo, though wee have cauſe to be humbled, yet wee cannot reject the Ordinance. When 'tis promiſed that the Woman ſhould be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Rev. 12.6.</hi> it muſt needs imply, that there ſhould be ſome Ordinances preſerved from corruption, in their eſſentials, and that Gods people ſhould be accepted in the uſe of them. Yet, that is no argument againſt coming out of the Wilderneſs; no more is the validneſs of Ordinances, in the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal, Claſſical, Parochial Churches, againſt ſeparating from them. And this ſeparation, doth not require rebaptization, for <hi>1</hi> The Scripture speaks nothing of it. <hi>2</hi> Wee muſt either own our Baptiſm, received in the Catholick viſible Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Mother, or in the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> or National Churches the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot Daughters; or elſe wee muſt conclude, that the Churches owned of God, during the four and twenty months of Antichriſt, of which, <hi>Rev. 11.4.</hi> ſhall want utterly the initiatory ſeal of the New Teſtament, and of this wee finde no preſident or hint in Scripture; Or elſe there muſt be an extraordinary way, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the loſt Ordinance of Baptiſm in theſe Churches, and of this, I know neither promiſe nor experience, for theſe hundreds of years, ſince there have been ſuch Churches. Therefore, the firſt muſt be granted; for, from the Churches reſt, till the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs began to ſet up particular viſible Churches, by the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> 'tis rare to finde a man, that would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any other Church than the Beaſt and his Images, that would acknowledge a particuliar viſible Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is hard for Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to manage an argument, that doth not fall back upon his <hi>cauſe.</hi> In anſwering this ſecond Objection, hee overthrows what hee had ſaid, and condemns his way of <hi>Separation;</hi> which will eaſily appear, in making his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118995:38"/> 
                  <hi>conceſſions</hi> to ſpeak out, what they at firſt ſight are capable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that way.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Hee grants, that <hi>when Ordinances are not corrupted in the eſſentials, but onely in the circumſtantials of them, wee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them;</hi> and thereby hee condemns his denying of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and Church-State to bee true, for are they corrupted in their <hi>eſſentials?</hi> Will not his diſtinction keep our <hi>Ordination, Miniſtery,</hi> and <hi>Church-State</hi> from being <hi>null,</hi> as well as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>Baptiſm?</hi> The ſame way as hee will maintain the validneſs of this, wee will the validneſs of thoſe; and the ſame exceptions that hee can make againſt the validneſs of thoſe, will equally ſtrike at the validneſs of this; Let him try and hee ſhall finde it to be ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hee grants that the Womans being nouriſhed in the Wilderneſs, implies, that <hi>Ordinances were preſerved in their eſſentials,</hi> and Gods people accepted in the uſe of them, and that <hi>there were Churches owned of God, during the four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty months of Antichriſt.</hi> Whereby, hee clearly condemneth that <hi>interciſion</hi> of a true <hi>Church-State,</hi> which hee had before aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, frequently and lately, p. 52. where hee ſaith, <hi>I deny them not</hi> (ſpeaking of Churches not <hi>Independent,</hi> and there were none conſiderable but ſuch till theſe late daies) <hi>to bee the Woman nouriſhed in the Wilderneſs, but I deny them to be the Candleſticks</hi> (that is true Churches, in his ſenſe.) And here, <hi>Till the</hi> Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>and</hi> Albigenſes, <hi>began to ſet up particular viſible Churches, 'tis very rare to finde a man, that would acknowledge any other Churches than the Beaſt and his Images.</hi> So alſo, hee condemns here, his reſtraining of a true Church-State to <hi>Independent</hi> Churches, in ſaying, that during that time (wherein hee ſaith there were Churches owned of God) <hi>particular viſible Churches,</hi> (that is as Independent) <hi>were not acknowledged.</hi> So that hence muſt bee inferred, whether hee will or no, that the Churches <hi>not Independent,</hi> renouncing <hi>Rome,</hi> during the four and twenty months, which includes our age, were and are <hi>true Churches,</hi> and ſo not to bee looked upon as <hi>Antichriſtian, and Harlot Daughters of</hi> Rome (as his charity calls them) nor to bee <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> from. Which would farther appear, if wee ſhould take in his notion of the <hi>Candleſticks</hi> (Sect. 4th.) for, they are in his ſenſe <hi>Churches,</hi> and they <hi>propheſie one thouſand two hundred and ſixty daies,</hi> which is four and twenty months <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3, 4
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118995:38"/> and there were during that time, till this laſt age, at leaſt till the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> by his own conceſſion, no conſiderable <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi> Churches; Therefore, the preceding Churches, not Independent, renouncing <hi>Rome</hi>-Papal, and <hi>ours</hi> their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, were and are <hi>true Churches,</hi> and (if Churches bee properly Witneſſes) at leaſt, as truly <hi>Witneſſes</hi> as the Congregational, and not to bee ſeparated from.</p>
               <p>But, hee ſeeming to foreſee, that hee opened us a gap to ſtrike at his ſeparation, ſaith, That <hi>the validneſs of Ordinances in our way, ſtands no more againſt ſeparating from our Churches, than the validneſs of them when received in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>againſt ſeparation from it.</hi> A doughty reaſoning. Hee knows, that wee plead, beſides the <hi>validneſs</hi> of Ordinances among us, a <hi>renouncing</hi> of the Idolatries of <hi>Rome's</hi> worſhip, and a <hi>Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> and owning of the true doctrines of Chriſtianity, in <hi>oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to <hi>Rome's</hi> blaſphemies and fundamental Antichriſtian er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. And ſurely, the validneſs of Ordinances ſo accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, renders a ſeparation from us, and our Churches, of quite another nature than that from Antichriſtian <hi>Rome;</hi> which, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs and prejudice lay not <hi>in many rolles</hi> upon the eies of his underſtanding, hee could not chuſe but ſee. Thus, the matter of his anſwer recoiles upon himſelf, of which more may bee ſaid, <hi>Sect.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>form</hi> of it, in relation to the Objection, it removes it not at all. For what ſaies hee? <hi>The Ordinances are not to be accounted eſſentially null, but the Church-State in the which they were adminiſtred is to bee accounted null;</hi> for hee calls all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, <hi>images of the Beaſt, and Harlot Daughters of</hi> Rome, and his way ſets up a new Church-State, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and differenced in <hi>eſſential</hi> reſpects from that of all thoſe Churches. Now, if their <hi>Church-State</hi> hath been null, their <hi>Miniſtery</hi> hath been null, and conſequently the <hi>Ordinances</hi> adminiſtered by ſuch a Miniſtery null, and ſo the Objection remains in full force againſt him, notwithſtanding all his ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to aſſoil it, and his principles drive to <hi>rebaptizing</hi> or <hi>Seekiſm,</hi> chuſe hee whether.</p>
               <p>Neither let him ſay, that this toucheth <hi>us alſo,</hi> who have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from <hi>Rome</hi> as a <hi>falſe Church,</hi> through which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding wee had our Miniſtery and Ordinances; for hee may know, and ſhall bee told anon, that our principles and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118995:39"/> about this matter, do exceedingly differ from his.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe this with thoſe <hi>Queries</hi> upon his riddles. 1 Are the <hi>Woman</hi> nouriſhed in the Wilderneſs, and the <hi>Churches</hi> owned of God during the four and twenty months, all one or not? 2 Had the Woman in the Wilderneſs, that had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances preſerved from corruption in their <hi>eſſentials,</hi> and was <hi>accepted</hi> in the uſe of them, any <hi>true Church-State</hi> or not? 3 Were the Churches that are ſaid to have been theſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years, and <hi>owned of God, Independent</hi> Churches or not? 4 Did the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes</hi> ſet up <hi>Independent</hi> Churches, which ſeem here to bee meant by <hi>particular viſible Churches?</hi> If I had his poſitive anſwer to theſe, I ſhould ſay ſomething more to him. But hee here delivers himſelf <hi>obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> about theſe things, as thoſe uſe to do that are ſuch as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>Object. 3 <q>But many godly men have worſhiped God zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this way, and do ſtill, and God hath been, and is ſtill, no queſtion,<note place="margin">P. 59. 60.</note> found of them. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This must be looked on as an indulgence of God unto ſincerity, owning what is of himſelf, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with much of man. They are much deceived, that think it is enough to ſay for a way, that they have found God in it, or rather in ſomething of his that is practiſed in it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Lord is <hi>found</hi> of any of us his poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſeeking him in his waies, wee humbly acknowledge to be of his gracious <hi>indulgence,</hi> owning what is of himſelf mingled with much of man. And will not you ſay the ſame concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>your ſelves?</hi> But that our way of worſhip, and our Church-State, are not in the main according to divine <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> is that which you have not, nor will ever prove. Wee grant, that <hi>they are much deceived, &amp;c.</hi> and it toucheth us not, for wee think not that it is <hi>enough</hi> to ſay ſo; And wee ſuppoſe, that this may better ſerve to indoctrinate thoſe of <hi>your way,</hi> than us; for it is not rare with many of them, to judge of a way, by the <hi>Impreſſions</hi> they have upon their ſpirits, concerning, or in the uſe of it, more than by <hi>Rule.</hi> But the Queſtion ſhould bee, whether God is <hi>as much found,</hi> of thoſe that ſeek him in a <hi>falſe way,</hi> and much ſwerving from his inſtitution, as of thoſe that ſeek him in a way <hi>conformable</hi> to his Inſtitution? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you will anſwer negatively. But now, through Gods goodneſs, wee are able to ſay, that God is and hath been <hi>as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118995:39"/> much found of us,</hi> in our Churches and way, and our Miniſters have received as glorious a <hi>ſeal of their Miniſtery,</hi> as any Churches that wee know of, ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> daies, and farre more than our <hi>Congregational</hi> Brethren themſelves in their way; who although they deal out this hard meaſure to us, to cry down our Miniſtery and Churches, as <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> owe moſt of them that are renewed, their converſion unto God, unto <hi>our Miniſtery,</hi> as the inſtrument for it in Gods hand, themſelves being Judges. Though they had <hi>ten thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Inſtructors,</hi> yet could they not ſay they are <hi>their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for in Chriſt Jeſus the Miniſtery of our Churches hath begotten them to the Goſpel.</hi> If I am become a <hi>fool</hi> in glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they have compelled mee.</p>
               <p>Object. 4 <q>But there may be, and hath been good done this way, errours ſuppreſſed, &amp;c. and thoſe that reject it now,<note place="margin">P. 61.</note> made uſe of it once. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The good that God brings out of evil, is not to be conſtrued into a divine approbation of it, Nor the uſe that hath been made by good men of a falſe way of Churches, to bee drawn into an argument to continue in it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What <hi>good</hi> there hath been done by <hi>reformed Churches,</hi> few can bee ignorant of: What good hath been done by <hi>Independent Churches,</hi> hath not yet much appeared. That ſome of their flocks are <hi>pure,</hi> they owe to <hi>our Churches,</hi> as hath been ſaid. <hi>Errours</hi> have been indeed <hi>ſuppreſſed by ours,</hi> but not by <hi>theirs,</hi> (it appears therefore they have made but a bad exchange;) but <hi>cheriſhed</hi> by many of them, who have been to them as <hi>Cities of refuge,</hi> and out of which they have ſwarmed abundantly, into all parts of the Land, and for this the Land <hi>groans.</hi> And thinks Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to put off this ſo ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with his begged ſuppoſition, of the truth of the Churches of <hi>his way,</hi> and the falſeneſs of <hi>ours?</hi> Surely, the beating down of errour, and the promoting of truth, is no contemptible note of a <hi>true Church,</hi> though ſome corruptions bee found in it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 4. and on the contrary, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That thoſe that <hi>owned</hi> our Churches once, have now <hi>rejected</hi> them, I judge from the word to be their <hi>ſin.</hi> They ſhould have continued in them, ſince Chriſt hath not divorced them (though he hath <hi>ſomewhat againſt them</hi>) and have indeavoured to <hi>reform</hi> them. But they have not laboured to <hi>heal,</hi> yea, they have <hi>widen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and encreaſed our wounds; and then they inſult over us, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianize</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:118995:40"/> us, <hi>ſeparate</hi> from us, and draw away the beſt of our flocks, <hi>boaſting in other mens lines, of things made ready to their hands.</hi> The Lord judge between us and them.</p>
               <p>Object. 5. and 6. <q>But, ſhall wee do it without the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Magistrate?<note place="margin">P. 62, 63, 64</note> without the conſent of the Church? <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which is preſſed, is but the doing of the duty that lies upon every Chriſtian, to ſeparate from unwarrantable ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Text hath no ſuch proviſo, if the Magiſtrate bid or give you leave, then come out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Therefore, wee are to reſolve with <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and with <hi>Wollebius,</hi> &amp;c. After God hath made known his truth, (ſaies the firſt) wee muſt not delay.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is as no body with you (unleſs you have him on your ſide, and then you can change your note.)

Can our Magiſtrates endure, that their authority and power ſhould bee contemned as it is? I hope they will not, but that they will exert it for the good of the Church, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing, reſtraining, and puniſhing, men of corrupt minds, principles, and practices, leading to ſeparation, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, errours and rebellion; ſheltring themſelves under this notion, that <hi>the Magiſtrate hath nothing to do with Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and that all men are therein to bee left to their liberty, and the dictates of their own ſpirits.</p>
               <p>The places that you pick out of <hi>Martyr</hi> and <hi>Wollebius,</hi> favour not your fancy. The place of <hi>Wollebius,</hi> taken in his ſenſe, I readily yeeld to. <hi>That when Religion is depraved, it is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Magiſtrate; But if reformation cannot be obtained of the Magiſtrate, hee being an enemy to the Church, then refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation lies upon thoſe whom God hath furniſhed with neceſſary gifts for it; neither is the conſent of</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhops to bee expected, for, if our Fathers had done ſo</hi> (ſaies hee) <hi>there would have been no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:118995:40"/> And hee produceth the examples of <hi>Gideon, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada, the Maccabes, the Apoſtles, &amp;c.</hi> to make good his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. Now when you ſhall have proved, 1 That the ſupreme <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is an <hi>enemy</hi> of Religion, the Church and reformation. 2 That the way of reformation you contend for, is indeed the <hi>way of God.</hi> 3 That all lawful <hi>means</hi> have been uſed, and notwithſtanding reformation cannot be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Magiſtrates hands. 4 That <hi>Englands</hi> condition, and the State of the Church in the time of <hi>Gideon, Jehoiada, the Maccabes, the Apoſtles, and Proteſtant reformers,</hi> are alike. 5 That you have Inſtruments that have the <hi>like call</hi> from God, and are furniſhed with ſuch <hi>abilities</hi> for reforming as they had and were; Then, I confeſs, this place will ſpeak ſomething for you. 6 The reformation <hi>Wollebius</hi> ſpeaks of, referres chiefly to <hi>eſſentials</hi> in Religion, and that hee is an Antagoniſt to your way of ſeparation from reformed Churches, appears ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in his book. <hi>Martyr</hi> you much miſtake alſo. 1 The reformation hee preſſeth, referres chiefly to <hi>fundamentals</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. 2 Thoſe whoſe <hi>conſent</hi> hee ſaies was not to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, were the <hi>Roman Biſhops,</hi> whom hee calls ſworn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the truth. 3 Hee doth not incite and ſtirre up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to ſet upon the work, <hi>without the conſent of the Magiſtrate,</hi> but the inferiour Magiſtrates, to endeavour in their places a reformation of Religion, in baniſhing the impure <hi>Maſſe</hi> out of their Cities, &amp;c. and how doth this reach your caſe? 4 <hi>The cauſe,</hi> hee ſaies, <hi>was clear, and ſuch as was confeſſed to be Gods, and delaies might indanger the loſs of a good cauſe. Conſent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> ſaies hee, <hi>is to be expected, if the matter bee dubious and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.</hi> And here you bring in your ſhameful Parentheſis <hi>(to wit, to whom it is revealed)</hi> which <hi>Parentheſis</hi> ſpoils and abuſeth <hi>Peter Martyrs Text;</hi> For his words clearly import, to any man that will read there, that the cauſe was not onely <hi>clear unto them, whom hee endeavours to intereſt in carrying on the work of reformation,</hi> but clear <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> and not as to its <hi>matter</hi> dubious and obſcure, being ſuch, as all the Churches on earth, but the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> would own. For ſhame, leave off your <hi>abuſing</hi> of Authors, at which work I have caught you more than once or twice in this Treatiſe. Again, your <hi>Parentheſis</hi> is full fraught with all ſeeds of <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt the State, as well as of <hi>confuſion</hi> in the Church of God. For, if men may freely follow
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118995:41"/> the apprehenſions of their own miſguided judgements, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded fancies, againſt the mind of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and conſent of the <hi>Church</hi> of God: How ſhall our Religion, or Liberties, Perſons Eſtates, or Lives bee ſecured to us? Probably, the late <hi>fift-Monarchy-Traitours,</hi> had read your Treatiſe. I find a harmony between their remonſtrance and your book, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſages; and I am ſure, they will aſſert the cauſe they undertook <hi>was clear to them,</hi> and then your parentheſis bears them out, <hi>they needed not to expect any conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You now conclude, notwithſtanding all Objections; <q>Let thoſe whoſe hearts God hath raiſed up, go up and build his houſe. Get wee our brethren,<note place="margin">p. 64.</note> if we can, along with us, but let us not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay our duty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, <hi>reformation</hi>-work is bleſſed work, but people had need to have <hi>better guides than you</hi> in it, leſt they miſtake their way, and whilſt they think they are flying <hi>from Babylon,</hi> they fly indeed <hi>into it;</hi> for thither your way drives, though I ſuppoſe you perceive it not. <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>you</hi> are farther agreed, than all men are aware of. 1 The <hi>Pope</hi> cries down all Churches as <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and <hi>heretical,</hi> but his own, eſpecially <hi>Proteſtant Churches.</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> proclaimes all Churches that are not of his way, to bee <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and eſpecially the Weſtern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, called <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to bee <hi>Babylon-Harlots,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Mr. <hi>P.</hi> is an earneſt contender for <hi>Democratical,</hi> and againſt <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Government. The Pope, hee hates a Scripture <hi>Presbytery</hi> at his heart, but favours, by his agents, <hi>Democratical</hi> government, hoping to work out his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes by it. And therefore, his diſguiſed Agents, inſinuate into <hi>Independent</hi> congregations, and ſtrengthen them in their way of independency and <hi>ſeparation,</hi> as that which beſt helps on their work, and gives them the greateſt advantage for the ſowing of their bad ſeed. Hence have proceeded from ſuch Congregations, <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>Popiſh</hi> doctrines and arguments in their mouths. Therefore let Mr. <hi>P.</hi> beware, leſt a <hi>blind zeal</hi> betray him, and that inſtead of a <hi>Reformer,</hi> hee prove a <hi>Deformer</hi> (leading men to <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt hee calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to come <hi>out of it</hi>) for men of his underſtanding, ſpirit, and confidence, are uſually in danger to prove ſuch in the end.</p>

               <p>Here hee ſeems to ſumme up his <hi>grounds,</hi> of ſo bold an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which ariſe from an interpretation of <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Chapter,</hi> hath alwaies much perplext Interpreters, to make out what is meant by theſe <hi>two Beaſts;</hi> both becauſe of what is ſaid of them, and becauſe they ſeem to bee ſpoken of as but <hi>one</hi> Beaſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. and chap. 17.

Nay, 'tis ſufficiently known, to thoſe that have acquainted themſelves with the carriages of our and their <hi>Church-guides,</hi> in theſe late years, that when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures were made by <hi>ours,</hi> for an accommodation, and for unity in reformation, upon Scripture principles, it was <hi>refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and the hopeful beginnings of it, broken off by <hi>them.</hi> Yet I muſt not be ſo much a Diſciple of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> as to ſay, that they were <hi>ſtubborn</hi> therein, though there bee much moer ground to ſay it of them, than of us. <hi>Falſe</hi> alſo it is, to ſay Univerſally, that Proteſtant Churches are <hi>not cured,</hi> by indeavours put forth for their cure; For, though not by <hi>Independents,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, yet by the indeavours of many zealous <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> much of that, which looked like ſomething of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118995:45"/> more according to the Traditions of men, than the word of God, hath been <hi>removed,</hi> and in particular in our Land; which notwithſtanding the <hi>prejudice</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> is overgrown with, hee cannot, I ſuppoſe, but acknowledge. I confeſſe, much of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption there is remaining, but ſuch as cannot by the rule of the Word, deprive Proteſtant Churches of their <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> or render it <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What hee ſaith next, <hi>That none of thoſe that would have a thorough Reformation, dare take their whole Pariſh along with them to the work,</hi> as it is nothing to his purpoſe (for corruption in <hi>manners,</hi> proves not a Church to bee Antichriſtian) ſo it is <hi>ridiculouſly</hi> propounded. For though a godly Miniſter, that is a Paſtor to a Pariſh-Congregation, think not <hi>all</hi> in a meetneſs for the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> nor admits them all to it; yet it follows not, that hee takes not the <hi>whole Pariſh-Congregation</hi> along with him to the work of Reformation, conſidering it in a Scriptural ſenſe. Hee may ſpeak to <hi>all,</hi> admoniſh <hi>all,</hi> inſtruct <hi>all,</hi> and indeavour to reform <hi>all,</hi> though hee adminiſter the Supper <hi>onely</hi> to thoſe who are fit for it; and it is one of Mr. <hi>P's Slanders,</hi> to ſay as hee doth of our Miniſters, that they <hi>lay aſide the moſt of their people, as the Jews the</hi> Samaritans; for they own their <hi>memberſhip,</hi> tell them in relation to the <hi>Supper,</hi> they have a <hi>Fundamental</hi> right, though not a <hi>proximate</hi> right to preſent participation, being as yet unfit; receive them to all Ordinances that they are capable to profit by, and exhort them to labour in the uſe of means, for fitneſſe for the uſe of <hi>all</hi> Ordinances, and then they ſhall rejoyce to adminiſter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Lords <hi>Supper</hi> to them; and is this to lay them <hi>aſide, as the Jews the</hi> Samaritans? No more, than the keeping from the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> under the Law, thoſe that were judged by the Law to bee in a preſent <hi>incapacity</hi> to uſe it.</p>
               <p>But, the mans head is full of his <hi>Democracy,</hi> which makes him meaſure us by his <hi>principle,</hi> and think, that thoſe whom wee admit to <hi>full communion,</hi> wee admit to exerciſe the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keyes</hi> alſo (which makes him talk, of <hi>taking them along with us to the work of reformation, and admitting them to the management of that matter</hi>) and that thoſe that are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all Ordinances, are quite <hi>laid aſide,</hi> becauſe 'tis ſo with him.</p>
               <p>To his Query, <hi>Why ſhould they bee waſhed at the ſame laver
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118995:45"/> (at leaſt their children) that may not eat at the ſame Table?</hi> If hee bee <hi>ignorant</hi> of our anſwers to it, let him read them in thoſe many <hi>Tracts</hi> that have them; and if hee bee <hi>not ignorant</hi> of them, why puts hee the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and that without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering our arguments for this practice? Some men will ask <hi>why?</hi> though they have been told why a hundred times, and can ſay <hi>nothing</hi> that is worth hearing againſt it.</p>
               <p>His <hi>inference</hi> from his ſorry Reaſons, the words of which hee borroweth, from that famous aſſertour of <hi>Reformed</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Lord <hi>Du Pleſſis,</hi> is a farther evidence of his <hi>weakneſs, miſtakes, and impudence.</hi> Our Churches, this man brands eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where as <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> it ſelf; but not one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of weight doth hee bring to prove it. Neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers hee the ſolid arguments of the <hi>godly-learned,</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſeparation</hi> from our Churches, as no true Churches, for a <hi>grievous ſin;</hi> which indeed ſhould have been properly his work (ſince hee had an <hi>itch</hi> to write) in regard, hee ſtands charged by thoſe writings, with this <hi>ſinne.</hi> But this, belike, hee finds too hard a task, and that it is eaſier to <hi>lay on,</hi> than to take <hi>off</hi> charges (and wee muſt not blame a man for not undertaking what hee cannot perform) and ſo inſtead of anſwering their arguments, ſometimes hee wreſts their words, and perverts their ſence, to make it <hi>ſerve his turn;</hi> Sometimes abuſeth their expreſſions for ſeparation from <hi>Rome,</hi> by preſſing them, for the ſervice of his unſcriptural ſeparation from <hi>reformed Churches,</hi> as he ſhamefully doth here, thoſe of this champion of the reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>Did ever <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> think, that his exhortation to ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould have been ſo much <hi>polluted</hi> and abuſed, as to bee managed for ſeparation from Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? or that the World would have produced a writer ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as to account <hi>reformed Churches,</hi> to bee yet <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>of,</hi> and <hi>the Babylon</hi> it ſelf? How could hee, if hee had any <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> left him, ſo much as name that woruhy <hi>Champion</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, when hee exhorts to <hi>ſeparation</hi> from them? But we ſhall have a worſe carriage of this nature to look upon, at the end of his book.</p>

                  <q>BEE wiſe O yee Kings, be inſtructed yee Judges of the earth. Take away Pariſhes, by an Act of State, away with all thoſe Conſecrated places for worſhip; Away with Patrons, or Lay-founders; Away with Tithes, &amp;c. Away, I ſay, with all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances of a Pariſh-Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Can this be Mr. <hi>P's</hi> voyce (I mean not in regard of the <hi>imperiouſneſs</hi> of it, for there is no ground to doubt it to be his on that account, but) <hi>appealing</hi> in matters that concern <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> to the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> whoſe power he hath ſo much decried? Strange, that theſe worldly Governments, whom hee exhorts men in his preface, <hi>not to accept as Law-givers,</hi> no not in the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and hopes Chriſt will in due time deliver us from, ſhould now be applied to by him, for the exerciſe of their power, and that in matters that concern <hi>Religion!</hi> What ſtrange liberty is this that he takes, to pul down Magiſtrates at his pleaſure, when they ſtand in his light, and ſet them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be his Servants, and drive on his deſignes? But poſſibly he means thoſe <hi>Rulers</hi> that Mr. <hi>Feak</hi> and his party (of which he hath manifeſted himſelf to be) would have in place of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and then his injunctions might have been deferred till <hi>their time,</hi> which I hope we ſhall never ſee. But conſider we a little what he doth enjoyn.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt, take away Pariſhes by an Act of State, the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs of them.</q> But, no Reaſon that he hath urged againſt them <hi>hitherto,</hi> will warrant it. What ſays he now for it? <q>
                     <hi>Hezekiah</hi> brake the brazen Serpent, becauſe the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did Idolize it. <hi>Joſiah</hi> demoliſhed the Altar of <hi>Bethel,</hi> and the high place there.</q> Rare arguing! What <hi>analogy</hi> is there between theſe things? Are Proteſtant Pariſh-congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions idolatrouſly <hi>worſhipped?</hi> becauſe, whilſt <hi>Rome</hi> was owned in them they were <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> are they to be demoliſhed now that they renounce it, and own Gods <hi>true worſhip?</hi> Are they like the Altar of <hi>Bethel,</hi> and the High-places, againſt Divine inſtitution, in <hi>place of being,</hi> and <hi>means of worſhip?</hi> For place,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118995:46"/> Churches are now confined to no ſet place, as that of the <hi>Jews</hi> was then, but may any where be made up of co-habiting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity. For the means of worſhip, let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge, whether he hath proved our Churches Idolatrous. And what would this Arguer ſay, I trow, from his inſtances, againſt thoſe <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, that are <hi>not Pariſhional</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. made up of Profeſſors, whoſe dwellings are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Popiſh Pariſhes, in compaſſes near to their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-places? Muſt they be <hi>taken away by an Act of State</hi> too, if ſuch a one could be procured there?</p>
               <p>Next, our <hi>Temples</hi> feel his wrath.</p>

                  <q>Away with all thoſe Conſecrated places for Worſhip,<note place="margin">P. 70. 71</note> thoſe holds of <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> Daemons, or Saint-Gods, as <hi>Mede</hi> expounds them; may monuments of Idolatry be better endured than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore? The argument for the demoliſhing of theſe is perpetual, and ſo the precept, <hi>Deut. 7.5, 6, 25, 26.</hi> the reaſon why they are ſuffered, is want of zeal, as is hinted by Maſter <hi>Cotton,</hi> Vial the <hi>7. p. 14.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I fear Mr. <hi>P's zeal</hi> is as miſguided, as that <hi>Luke</hi> 9.54, 55. want of due conſideration, and the power of prejudice, and wrath, doe, it is to be feared, kindle his zeal. For, are our Temples <hi>holds of</hi> Mahuzzim <hi>now?</hi> Is any Saint-God, but the holy <hi>Trine-une-God,</hi> worſhipped and owned in them, as their Protector and Defender? How untrue is Mr. <hi>P's</hi> inſinuation of it? Surely, learned <hi>Mede</hi> is much abuſed by him (as are moſt of the <hi>Non-congregational</hi> Authors, whom he quotes) in being made, from that expreſſion he mentions, to account our Temples <hi>holds of Mahuzzim;</hi> whereas, he intends it only for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Temples, where <hi>Saints</hi> are worſhipped; diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proteſtants from Papiſts, <hi>p.</hi> 101. <hi>True Chriſtians have with</hi> David <hi>one</hi> Mahoz, <hi>but apoſtate Chriſtians have their many Mahuzzims;</hi> and how much he was for the <hi>holineſs</hi> of our <hi>Churches,</hi> as places not Idolatrous and prophane, his tract bearing that name, with that of <hi>the reverence of Gods houſe,</hi> and ſeveral other places in his works, doe ſufficiently demonſtrate, to ſhame Mr. <hi>P.</hi> if he be not <hi>perfrictae frontis.</hi> But ſayes Mr. P. <hi>They are monuments of Idolatry, and may they be better endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than heretofore?</hi> Here he reaſons ſtrangely; for, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were <hi>heretofore</hi> abuſed to Idolatry, they may not be uſed <hi>now</hi> without Idolatry, but muſt be pulled down: then
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118995:47"/> the <hi>Temple</hi> ſhould have been deſtroyed, and not uſed for the performing of the worſhip of God in it by <hi>Joſiah,</hi> becauſe <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> his father had ſet up <hi>Idolatrous Altars for all the Hoſt of Heaven, and a carved Image</hi> in it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.4, 5, 7. but he neither pulls down, nor ſcrupleth worſhipping in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when he had purged it, which yet he ſhould have done by Mr. <hi>P's</hi> doctrine; becauſe his father had made it a <hi>monument of Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In times near the <hi>Primitive,</hi> Chriſtians ſcrupled not to uſe for Chriſtian worſhip, <hi>Temples</hi> before uſed for the worſhip of <hi>Pagan gods,</hi> when they came to be in their power; neither, I beleeve, would the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who preached upon <hi>Mars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil,</hi> have ſcrupled to have uſed them for the worſhip of God, if they had been in the hands of Chriſtians in his time. About the text in <hi>Deut.</hi> (however confidently he build his Temple-demoliſhing doctrine upon it) he is much deceived; and hath need to be taught, that the <hi>reaſon</hi> of thoſe precepts, for the deſtroying of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> places and means of worſhip, and not uſing them in Gods ſervice, was, that God had purpoſed and appointed, that there ſhould be but <hi>one only place,</hi> in the whole Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to which they were to bring their gifts, offerings, and ſacrifices, as the Levitical Law required; which is expreſly told us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.1. to 8. And we find, that that precept, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. did not bind them to <hi>demoliſh,</hi> and reject from being uſed in Gods ſervice, <hi>whatſoever</hi> was abuſed to undue worſhip. The <hi>Cenſers</hi> of the two hundred and fifty, that ſhould not have offered incenſe, were made <hi>broad plates</hi> for the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Altar,</hi> Numb. 16.39. and the Cenſers that <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> put ſtrange fire in, were not, that we read of, caſt away, and made no uſe of in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and therefore probably <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and <hi>Ithamar,</hi> that ſucceeded, uſed them. Our Temples, many of them had a being before the <hi>Popiſh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion prevailed in our Land, and ſome of them have been built <hi>ſince</hi> it was removed, and had they been all erected du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the prevalency of that religion, yet their uſe being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to the worſhipping and religious honouring of God alone, they are no more <hi>holds of Mahuzzim,</hi> but <hi>Temples of Chriſt.</hi> As to Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> opinion, which he mentions, it is built upon exceeding ſlender grounds. He, <hi>p.</hi> 9. &amp; 14. doth expound, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.20. thus. <hi>By Iſlands are meant Church-yards, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118995:47"/> ther grounds conſecrated by Popiſh devotions; by Mountains, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches, and all thoſe high places that over-top the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</hi> Hence he concludes, <hi>when the zeal of God lifts up the hearts of his people, they will not endure a Conſecrated place in the world.</hi> With reverence to Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> piety and learning, let the judicious Reader judge, whether <hi>any thing</hi> may not bee ſaid and inferred, at this rate of interpreting. Never did any man in the Chriſtian Church ſo interpret this text; neither can it in any reaſon be thought to be the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt; but rather, that <hi>Iſlands</hi> and <hi>Mountaines</hi> are put for <hi>places of ſtrength,</hi> and the powers in them, wherein <hi>Rome</hi> relies, and which in the overthrow of <hi>Babylon,</hi> though ſhe look for <hi>help</hi> from them, are not able to afford it her, but <hi>fall,</hi> as many as adhere to her, under ruin themſelves; which is, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the beſt Interpreters, underſtand by it.</p>
               <p>But would you think, that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> that inveighs thus againſt our <hi>Temples,</hi> ſhould <hi>uſe them himſelf?</hi> He tells us plainly, that he not only hath done, and doth, but alſo hints that hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to continue ſo to doe; and that with the help of this pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſtinction.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I confeſs, were it not to cry out againſt the Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 71, 72, &amp; 81.</note> and gain an advantage of ſpeaking, that otherwiſe I cannot have, after the example of the Churches meeting in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch, after the Temple was aboliſhed, <hi>Act. 5.12.</hi> I would never more preach, or perform any holy duty in them. I could not meet with the Pariſh, were it not that I come as a Prophet from <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>Bethel</hi> to them, to cry out againſt the Altar there; or upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Churches meeting, not theirs primarily.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If he comes as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> yet will he ſay, he is ſo <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> a Prophet, as to have a diſpenſation, <hi>to doe evil that good may come of it,</hi> which the great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> durſt not doe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8? Surely his practice ſpeaks it in effect, ſuppoſing that he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that to be true, which he hath delivered, that our <hi>Temples</hi> are <hi>high places,</hi> and that it is equally <hi>ſin</hi> to uſe them, at it was to uſe theſe. Either he muſt recant what he hath ſaid, or he muſt acknowledge that he doth evil (to him evil) that good may come of it. If this confident <hi>accuſer</hi> charge us, who are not convinced of the <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> of our <hi>Temples,</hi> of living in a ſinful practice, for uſing them: how deeply may <hi>he</hi> be charged for uſing them, who accounts them <hi>holds of Daemons, Idolatrous</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:118995:48"/> high places, not to be endured by any zealous perſon, ſuch as God expreſly forbids men to have to doe with? But let us conſider his <hi>pretences,</hi> for the warrantableneſs of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, notwithſtanding his Principle; what weight are they of? even none.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>He comes as a Prophet from</hi> Judah <hi>to</hi> Bethel, <hi>to cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Altar there.</hi> But ſurely, (beſides that he can never ſhew ſuch a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> for his inveighing againſt our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as that Prophet had, to declare againſt the Idolatrous Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> as may be eaſily concluded from what hath been ſaid) it is plain, that he uſeth not our Temples <hi>alwayes</hi> on this account, but <hi>commonly,</hi> for the performing of Divine ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to God, with the people that are with him, in the uſe of all Ordinances; which I am certain, that Prophet would not have done at the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Bethel.</hi> So that, this is but a meer empty pretence.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>He doth it to gain an advantage to cry out againſt the Altar, &amp;c. that otherwiſe hee cannot have, after the example of the Church,</hi> Act. 5. But, (beſides, as I have ſaid, that this is not <hi>commonly</hi> his work, when he appears in our Temples, but to uſe <hi>ordinarily</hi> Gods Ordinances with the people there, which the Prophet would not have done at the Altar of <hi>Bethel,</hi> and which we read not that the Apoſtles did in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch, though if they had, the caſe had been farre different from that in hand) Can he not cry out againſt the Altar, &amp;c. <hi>elſewhere,</hi> and that with more probable <hi>advantage?</hi> Would it not better ſuit with Mr. <hi>P's</hi> Principles, to aſcend to the top of the <hi>Market-place,</hi> or upon ſome <hi>Scaffold</hi> erected on purpoſe, and there to cry out againſt our <hi>Temples?</hi> And I dare ſay, in ſo doing, hee ſhall have <hi>more</hi> hearers than he can expect in a <hi>Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He meets with the Pariſh in the Temple, upon the account of the Churches meeting there, not theirs primarily.</hi> But, cannot his Church meet <hi>elſewhere?</hi> Surely, after all his <hi>drawing away</hi> of the Members of our Churches, his company is not <hi>ſo bigge,</hi> but that ſome <hi>room</hi> of theirs may contain them, as it doth when they liſt; and, one would think, this <hi>Prophet</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and lead his flock better, than to carry them to, and ſuffer them to meet and worſhip God, in an <hi>Idolatrous place,</hi> as unwarrantable to be uſed, in his judgement, as the <hi>high-places,</hi> and the <hi>Altar of</hi> Bethel in <hi>Iſraels</hi> time. 'Tis a ſad thing, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118995:48"/> this <hi>Prophet</hi> ſhould be ſo like that other <hi>old Prophet,</hi> mentioned, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.18, 19, &amp;c. he in his practice leads his people to uſe our <hi>Temples;</hi> and yet in his doctrin hee <hi>condemns</hi> the uſe of them, as very ſinful, Idolatrous, and not to be practiſed by any; and thereby condemns, both <hi>thoſe</hi> who are led by him into this practice, and <hi>himſelf</hi> much more, who is found, and leads others into it, contrary to his principles, convictions, and doctrin. Is it not to be feared, that in this he is not a <hi>true Prophet</hi> of the Lord? and that his <hi>voyce</hi> in this Book is no more <hi>from Heaven,</hi> than the Meſſage of that <hi>old Prophet</hi> was <hi>from an Angel?</hi> But yet, attend we his third injunction.</p>

               <p>Certainly, Mr. <hi>P. invents</hi> a crime againſt <hi>Patrons,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of our days. Doe they <hi>appoint</hi> the Congregations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors? ſurely he dreams; they only preſent Miniſters to Congregations already <hi>formed;</hi> and if thoſe Miniſters can bee proved by any in thoſe Congregations, to be <hi>unfit</hi> to be over them in the Lord, there is now, and hath commonly been, by publick appointment, a way to keep them out, and make the preſentation <hi>null;</hi> but if they have no valid exception againſt them, what harm is there done by the Patrons preſenting? I ſhall not here ſpeak to Patrons right; But I think, their uſing of that priviledge of <hi>nominating</hi> Miniſters to places (which was beſtowed upon them at firſt, by the favour of <hi>Princes,</hi> that men might be thereby encouraged to ſo good a work, as buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Temples,</hi> and endowing them with <hi>means,</hi> to maintain <hi>Miniſters</hi> to preach there, for the edification of Souls) cannot truly be termed, an <hi>uſurping of the Prerogative of Chriſt,</hi> nor an <hi>exerciſing if tyranny over the people.</hi> Miniſters may have <hi>Chriſts miſſion,</hi> either wholly, or inchoatively by fitneſs, and a true deſire of edifying Souls in the Miniſtery, though they bee <hi>preſented</hi> by <hi>Patrons;</hi> yea, Patrons preſent them, upon the account that they apprehend them to have Chriſts <hi>miſſion;</hi> and <hi>people</hi> have ſufficient means to <hi>invalidate</hi> the Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (eſpecially among us) in caſe they can evidence them to

               <p>All which things conſidered, as I cannot look on their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting as an exerciſing of Tyranny over the people: So I think, that places are <hi>better</hi> provided for this way, conſidering the condition of our Churches, than if they had the full power of nominating, <hi>chuſing,</hi> and admitting their Miniſters.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>P.</hi> would have done well, ſince hee accounts the preſentations of Patrons ſuch <hi>abominations,</hi> to have inſtructed, and reproved,<note place="margin">Mr. L.</note> one of his chief <hi>members,</hi> who, not long ago, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt his <hi>Antipatronical</hi> doctrin.

Therefore, Tythes belong to the Ceremonial Law, which to practiſe, is to dig Chriſt out of his grave, and a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Antichriſt. Neither will it avail, for any to ſay, that they take them not as Tythes, for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> could not be ſo excuſed, as to their eating things ſacrificed to Idols, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> knoweth, or might know, that there are ſeveral pleas for <hi>Tythes,</hi> as the Miniſters maintenance; <hi>The Power and Laws of the Magistrate, The right of Donation,</hi> and <hi>The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right.</hi> And therefore, ſince hee thought fit, to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his <hi>excommunicatory</hi> ſentence againſt them, with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>laſt</hi> of thoſe pleas, hee ſhould have <hi>done</hi> it, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>reſt</hi> alſo. Elſe, though it ſhall happen, that his <hi>ſtrong</hi> arguing may cauſe men to <hi>quit</hi> them with <hi>one hand,</hi> on the laſt account; yet the other <hi>pleas,</hi> being not impugned by him in particular, they may hold them with the <hi>other hand,</hi> on <hi>their</hi> account; and ſo, his <hi>away with Tythes,</hi> may loſe its labour. Two Cords may hold them, though the edge of his arguing, ſhould bee ſo keen, as to cut the other.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The <hi>Magistrates Power,</hi> and Authority, is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, to have been given them by God, in relation to the good of the <hi>Church;</hi> and cannot fairly bee denied, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf, by his appointment, to the <hi>Teachers,</hi> as well as to the taught in it. Thoſe muſt live, and bee maintained, as well as theſe; the text hee quotes, evinceth this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13, 14. and Magiſtrates are to take care, that what God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, may bee <hi>performed;</hi> how are they elſe, <hi>Miniſters of God, for good,</hi> without exception or reſtriction? Now the <hi>even ſo,</hi> in this Text (leaving his apprehenſion, of the farther ſenſe of it, to bee conſidered under the laſt plea) implies clearly, that a <hi>ſet, determinate, and ſufficient maintenance,</hi> is to bee aſſigned, and paid to the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them (for ſuch a one there was injoyed, by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of holy things, under the Law) and ſurely, the effecting of this, falls under the Chriſtian Magiſtrates care, and is within the verge of his power. But now, certainly, there is no reaſon, why the Magiſtrate may not appoint, as well a <hi>tenth,</hi> as a <hi>ninth,</hi> or <hi>an eleventh,</hi> to bee the <hi>Miniſters maintenance;</hi> And having ſo fair a <hi>precedent</hi> before them, as the determinate proportion, once allotted by <hi>God</hi> to his Miniſters, n. a <hi>Tenth;</hi> and no other mentioned in Scripture: No reaſon can bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118995:52"/> (ſuppoſing them not to conſider that allotment as binding now) why they ſhould not pitch upon this, rather than any other. The <hi>equity</hi> of that proportion, doth undoubtedly ſtill remain; it is the proportion which the wiſdome of God <hi>choſe,</hi> and hee hath no where <hi>forbidden</hi> them to pitch upon that proportion, or pointed out any <hi>other;</hi> therefore, that proportion they may <hi>beſt</hi> pitch upon, and eſtabliſh to bee the Miniſters maintenance. This proportion, Chriſtian Magiſtrates, and <hi>ours</hi> in particular, have pitched upon, and eſtabliſhed by Laws to be the Miniſters main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and that out of the <hi>increaſe of the land,</hi> which might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be proved, to be the moſt fit, certain Maintenance, the moſt ſuitable, to al incident conditions of the land, that can be found.</p>
               <p>And why, upon this account, may not Tythes bee appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and maintained by the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> required by the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and payed by the <hi>People?</hi> What Law of God, do thoſe, or theſe, ſin againſt herein? Suppoſe the determinate propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and way of maintenance, not expreſſed and determined by God, now in New-Teſtament-daies, but onely that there ſhould bee a <hi>fit</hi> Maintenance; Doth not the determining of the way and proportion of maintenance, belong to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate? And is this way and proportion <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> when they pitch not upon it on the Jewiſh account, as any way a part of, or ſubſervient to the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law? Or is it <hi>oppreſſive,</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable</hi> (as ſome complain) ſeeing it is the <hi>equitable</hi> way, which the <hi>wiſdome of God</hi> once appointed, for his Miniſters maintenance? Is not here a ſufficient <hi>bottome,</hi> for any mans ſpirit to reſt upon, in relation to <hi>Tythes?</hi> But if this were not enough,</p>
               <p n="2">2 None can deny, that men may <hi>give</hi> away, and perpetually <hi>bequeath</hi> to others, the <hi>tenth part</hi> of the profits of their goods, lands, and inheritances. If any man of Mr. <hi>P's.</hi> Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould bequeath to him and his Succeſſours, the future Paſtors of that Congregation, the <hi>tenth part</hi> of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per revenues for ever; might not hee, and his Succeſſors law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>claim</hi> and <hi>injoy</hi> it? would not their <hi>title</hi> bee good to it? Now thus it is, in the caſe of <hi>Miniſters claiming, and taking Tythes in</hi> England; as is ſufficiently known, to any that know any thing to purpoſe, in this matter.

And this appears yet further, by a Law of King</hi> Athelſtanes, <hi>made in the year</hi> 930. <hi>about which time not onely the Prelates of the Church, as formerly, but the great men of the Realm, began to be ſettled in eſtates of permanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to claim a property in thoſe Lands which they held of the Crown, and claiming ſo, begun it ſeems, to make bold to ſubduct their Tithes. For remedy whereof, the King made this Law, commanding all his Miniſters, throughout the Kingdome, that in the firſt place, they ſhould pay the Tythes of his own eſtate (which hee held in his own hands, and had not eſtated out to his Lords and Barons) and that the Biſhops did the like of what they held in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118995:53"/> right of their Churches, and his Nobles and Officers of that which they held in property, as their own poſſeſſions, or inheritance. So then, the Land being charged thus with the paiment of Tythes, came with this clog unto the Lords, and great men of the Realm, and hath been ſo tranſmitted, and paſſed over, from one hand to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, until it came to the poſſeſſion of the preſent owners; who, whatſoever right they have to the other nine parts, either of Fee-ſimple, Leaſe, or Copy, have certainly none at all in the Tythe or tenth, which is no more theirs, or to be ſo thought of, than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nine parts are the Clergies. For in whatſoever tenure they hold their Lands, they purchaſed them, on this tacit condition, that beſides the Rents and Services they pay to the Lord, they are to pay to the Clergy, or thoſe who ſucceed in their right, a tenth of all the fruits of the earth, and of the fruits of their Cattel, and all Creatures tytheable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, by how many <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> Tithes have been confirmed to the <hi>Clergy</hi> on this account, in the reigns of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of our <hi>Princes,</hi> unto this day; appears fully in the Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of learned Lawyers, as alſo what care hath been taken, for the true paiment of them.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, it is evident, that by <hi>Donation,</hi> the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath as good a civil right to the <hi>Tithes,</hi> as any other perſons have to the other <hi>nine parts</hi> poſſeſſed by them. And I fear therefore, that many of thoſe who are now ſo hot for the aboliſhing of <hi>Tithes,</hi> would ſoon labour, if they had power in their hands, to extinguiſh <hi>Landlords Rents</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Tithes</hi> are made over and held, may be claimed, and ought to be paid, on the account of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> lawful <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi> determination, and Laws, and the <hi>right</hi> of ancient <hi>Donation</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> And theſe <hi>two</hi> grounds, well-conſidered, are ſufficient to ſatisfie any man, that there is no need to <hi>take them away,</hi> though the <hi>Divine right</hi> of them ſhould not bee made good. Sufficeth, there is a firm <hi>civil</hi> right for them. But yet, becauſe Mr. <hi>P.</hi> is ſo <hi>confident,</hi> and <hi>peremptory,</hi> in denying and oppoſing the <hi>Divine right</hi> of Tithes (though, as his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is, he anſwers not the many and weighty arguments, urged by no mean Divines, and Maſters of reaſon for it) I ſhall view what hee ſaith to that plea. Conſider wee then, that,</p>
               <p n="3">3 Some plead for <hi>Tithes,</hi> upon the account of <hi>Divine right;</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:118995:54"/> alledging, that this way of Miniſters maintenance, by Tithes, was appointed by God <hi>before the Law,</hi> and <hi>under the Law,</hi> and is not <hi>repealed,</hi> or any other ſubſtituted in its <hi>room,</hi> by the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And that therefore, Tythes are due by a <hi>Moral,</hi> and perpetually binding Law of God.</p>
               <p>What ſays Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to this? <hi>It is an Old-Teſtament mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi> Be it ſo, this is that is pleaded. The older the better, as to evidence, if it be not <hi>repealed.</hi> The <hi>Sabbath</hi> is an <hi>Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> Ordinance, and hath no New-Teſtament Law, expreſt, to eſtabliſh it; will he therefore ſay, <hi>away with the Sabbath?</hi> What ſaith he to the <hi>repeal</hi> of Tythe-maintenance? <hi>It ſeems to me, plainly diſtinguiſhed, from the New-Teſtament maintenance, in that,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.13, 14. <hi>Plainly!</hi> Every man hath not ſo good eyes as Mr. <hi>P.</hi> I ſee not the leaſt appearance of any ſuch thing, in that text. 'Tis well he ſays, <hi>to me plainly;</hi> for I dare engage, upon my little reading, that no <hi>Expoſitor</hi> of note, did ever ſee any ſuch thing, in this Scripture, much leſs <hi>ſee it plainly.</hi> Some of them have thought, they have ſeen the contrary to this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, and have pleaded from the SO, for the Divine right of <hi>Tythes:</hi> but none that I know of, did ever behold the maintenances plainly, or indeed at all, <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> in it. This ſharpneſs of ſight, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſhall carry away the glory of. Well, but he will make us ſee it. Behold we then. <hi>'Tis plain,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>he argues</hi> a Simili, <hi>from the like, and like is not the ſame.</hi> Now, it is <hi>plain to me,</hi> that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> underſtands not the text, and that he abuſeth Logick; though not out of <hi>ill will</hi> to it, I ſuppoſe. The Logick is too too bad, even for a <hi>Midſummer Bachelaur.</hi> For the <hi>axiome,</hi> as uſed by him, hath a groſs <hi>fallacy</hi> in it, <hi>A dicto ſecundum quid, ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> It is true, that like is not, cannot be, the ſame <hi>Numerically,</hi> but it may be the ſame <hi>Specifically,</hi> and is; and, if Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had been better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> hee might have known ſo much. <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe then, the Apoſtle to argue from the <hi>like,</hi> when hee argues for a Goſpel-maintenance, from the conſideration of the maintenance had under the Law; doth it follow, he muſt mean <hi>another kind of maintenance,</hi> by that which he pleads for? Are not Tythes paid under the Law, and Tythes paid under
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118995:54"/> the Goſpel, <hi>alike,</hi> as Tythes paid? and yet, are not they <hi>the ſame,</hi> as they are <hi>one kind of maintenance?</hi> May not Mr. <hi>P's</hi> Succeſſor in his Church, have ſuch a maintenance as hee hath, a maintenance <hi>like</hi> his, and yet the <hi>ſame kind</hi> of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance?</p>
               <p>But, if Mr. <hi>P's</hi> Logick were as good as it is bad, yet he hath no footing in the Text for his arguing, hee plainly miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it. For the context, compared with the text, evinceth, that the Apoſtles aim and ſcope is not to compare the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as to their <hi>peculiar kind,</hi> but to prove that mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is due to Goſpel Miniſters for their work, as well as it was to legal Miniſters for theirs. A maintenance theſe had, whereby they did live, and had a ſubſiſtence ſuitable to their condition, as Miniſters of holy things; and a maintenance thus ſufficient, whereby they may live as Goſpel Miniſters, he argues thoſe ought to have, by the Lords Ordinance. He that ordained, that <hi>Legal Miniſters</hi> ſhould have a <hi>ſufficient and honourable</hi> maintenance, hath alſo, yea and <hi>therein,</hi> ordained that <hi>Goſpel Miniſters</hi> ſhould have <hi>ſuch</hi> a maintenance. Gods Ordinance in this reſpect reacheth the one as well as the other, and is accordingly applied by the Apoſtle, to all Miniſters of holy things as <hi>one</hi> in this thing, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>For our ſakes no doubt this is written,</hi> that is, for the ſakes of all Miniſters of holy things. <hi>God</hi> would have them ſubſiſt, by a ſufficient and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable maintenance. Thus this <hi>plain</hi> text is <hi>plainly</hi> nothing to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But, he hath more than one ſtring to his bow. Next comes an Argument, that he thinks will doe the deed. The ſumme of it is this. <hi>Tythes are paid, neither by the light of Nature, nor by a Moral command; for the inſtances of</hi> Abrahams <hi>and</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs <hi>paying Tythes will not evidence ſo much; for Circumciſion was of the Fathers, and yet obliged to keep the whole Law; and Sacrifices were as old as</hi> Cain <hi>and</hi> Abel, <hi>yet part of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law. Again, no Gospel-Law is inconſiſtent with a Natural or Moral Law; but the inſtitution of our Saviour for maintenance, explained</hi> Gal. 6.6. <hi>will not ſtand with Tythes. Therefore they are paid by a Ceremonial precept, and belong to the Ceremonial Law, which to practiſe is to digge Chriſt out of his Grave, and a character of Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Strange <hi>confidence</hi> this, to build ſo peremptorily, ſo deep, ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:118995:55"/> cenſuring a <hi>concluſion,</hi> on ſuch ſlenderly-proved <hi>premiſes.</hi> Two Reaſons he hath here, why Tythes are not paid by a <hi>Moral</hi> command, which pretend to overthrow two of thoſe, whereby they that are for the Divine right of them, aſſert that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a <hi>Moral</hi> command.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>The inſtances of</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>will not ſerve the turn</hi> for it. And why I pray? We know, the <hi>Priesthood</hi> to which <hi>Abraham</hi> paid was not <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> and no Scripture tells us, his <hi>payment</hi> was a branch of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law. The portion due to <hi>Melchiſedecks</hi> Prieſthood, is due to the Prieſthood of Chriſt, it being after the order of his; and ſo to <hi>Gospel Ministers,</hi> as Chriſts ſervants. If therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> in duty paid Tythes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, to <hi>Melchiſedecks</hi> Prieſthood, are they not now to be paid, to the Prieſthood of Chriſt, and received by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters? No, ſaith Mr. <hi>P. for Circumciſion and Sacrifices were before the Law, and yet did belong to the Ceremonial Law, and are aboliſhed.</hi> What a wonderful <hi>confutation</hi> is this? For, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that hee ſaith nothing, to what is commonly alledged concerning <hi>Melchiſedecks</hi> Prieſthood, when that inſtance is urged) doth it follow, that becauſe <hi>Circumciſion and Sacrifices,</hi> that were before and under the Law, are aboliſhed, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Tythes,</hi> that were ſo, are aboliſhed alſo? certainly by no Logick but Mr. <hi>P's.</hi> For the two former we have <hi>expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> declaring that they are aboliſhed, but not ſo for the latter. It is not every thing that was appointed before the Law, and continued under the Law, and was not explicitely <hi>recommanded</hi> by the Goſpel, that is aboliſhed (for ſo the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> it ſelf ſhould be aboliſhed) but, what the <hi>declared will</hi> of God hath aboliſhed. Therefore Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hath but confirmed the oppoſite argument. <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tythes by <hi>command;</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> denies it not. That command is not expreſly and explicitely <hi>repealed,</hi> as are thoſe for <hi>Circumciſion and Sacrifices;</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> doth not ſhew, or ſay that it is. What hinders then, but that it ſhould be looked upon as a <hi>Moral</hi> and perpetually binding command? It muſt be his ſecond Reaſon, if any thing, for his firſt ſays, <hi>it is not in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The Aſſumption</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is manifeſt, becauſe no Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Gospel, is inconſiſtent with a Natural or Moral Law of God: But the institution of our Saviour, explained</hi> Gal. 6.6. <hi>will not ſtand with Tythes; theſe are out of the ſeed of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118995:55"/> land, the firſt fruit of the trees, and the herd, or flock; The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-maintenance, is raiſed out of all good things, that the perſon taught hath. Tythes were paid, the firſt tenth to the Levites, and they paid the tenth of the tenth to the Prieſts, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Reaſon is Mr. <hi>Hookers,</hi> and (ſaving the reverence due to ſo worthy a man) may juſtly bee ſaid, to have no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency at all in it. Tythes may very well conſiſt with Chriſts inſtitution, for Miniſters maintenance, as explained, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. For 1 Suppoſe this expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>in all good things,</hi> bee as <hi>comprehenſive,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> would have it: Yet, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not, but that under the Law Tythes were ſo paid. No places in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that mention <hi>Predial</hi> Tythes, do reſtrain the payment to them, excluding <hi>perſonal</hi> Tythes. The Law mentions the <hi>chief,</hi> and comprehends under them the reſt; as may appear, by conſidering, that neither <hi>graſs,</hi> nor <hi>hony,</hi> nor <hi>wax,</hi> nor ſeveral other things, that might bee men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are referrible to any of the mentioned expreſſions, being neither of <hi>the ſeed of the Land,</hi> nor <hi>the fruit of Trees,</hi> nor <hi>of the herd, or flock,</hi> which yet, no man doubts, I ſuppoſe, but were tithed. Therefore, Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> could not on <hi>ſufficient</hi> ground ſay, that the Tythes under the law, were <hi>not of all good things,</hi> even in his ſenſe. Nay, there is as expreſs a place, to prove that Tythes under the Law, were paid of all <hi>good things,</hi> as this <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. is for the communicating maintenance out of them, under the Goſpel, which is <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. <hi>I give Tythes</hi> (ſaies the Phariſee) <hi>of all that I poſſeſſe.</hi> Is not, <hi>all that I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs,</hi> as fully expreſſive, as, <hi>all good things?</hi> 2 May not <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. mean <hi>ſuitably to the Law?</hi> In all good things, that is, in all things communicable, and whereof a portion was to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Miniſters, under the <hi>Law.</hi> If it muſt bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a <hi>limitted</hi> ſenſe (as who can doubt but it muſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to many particulars) where ſhall wee have a rule to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, and bound it, but the practice under the <hi>Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 What ever becomes of the Tythe <hi>under the Law,</hi> wee are ſure, wee can match this expreſſion, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. with thoſe, whereby <hi>Abraham's</hi> and <hi>Jacob's</hi> paying of Tythes, <hi>before the Law</hi> (which is firſtly to bee heeded in this buſineſſe) is ſet forth.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Abraham,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.20. <hi>Hee gave him Tithes of ALL, ſpoiles</hi> and all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.4. And ſaies <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28.22.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118995:56"/> 
                  <hi>Of ALL that thou ſhalt give mee, I will ſurely give the tenth unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where lies the Reaſon now, why the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt for Miniſters maintenance, ſhould not ſtand with <hi>Tythes?</hi> That requireth, men ſhould communicate to Miniſters, <hi>in all good things,</hi> and herein it is anſwerable to the <hi>Law of Tythes,</hi> for <hi>Abraham</hi> before the Law, gave tythes to <hi>Melchiſedeck of all,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> Tythes to God <hi>of all,</hi> and perſons under the Law (as appears by that of the Phariſee) gave tithes <hi>of all that they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed;</hi> and theſe, cannot but bee deemed, to have acted therein according to Gods <hi>Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the other branch of this ſecond reaſon, that the <hi>firſt tenth was under the Law to the Levite,</hi> &amp;c. it ſpeaks nothing at all, for the inconſiſtency of Tythes with Chriſts inſtitution. For, that <hi>order</hi> and <hi>diſtinction</hi> is acknowledged on all hands, to have been Ceremonial, and <hi>adventitious</hi> to the <hi>nature</hi> of the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Wee muſt ſtrip the Ordinance of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> it ſelf, of <hi>morality,</hi> if wee will have no appointment moral, that was attended, under the Law, with ſomething <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, it may clearly appear, to the conſiderate Reader, that as yet Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hath not made his <hi>aſſumption</hi> manifeſt, but rather his <hi>weakneſſe;</hi> neither of his <hi>Reaſons</hi> holding good. And therefore, conſequently, his flouriſhing concluſion makes but a <hi>vainſhew.</hi> Hee hath no way proved, that Tythes are paid by a <hi>Ceremonial Precept,</hi> and belong to the Ceremonial Law. And withall, hee hath avoided, or omitted, one <hi>great part</hi> of his task under ſuch an attempt; n. to prove that, and ſhew how, Tythes 1 were a <hi>ſhadow of Chriſt, or grace to come by Chriſt here;</hi> in the Law for them, nature of them, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them; 2 <hi>Analogically repreſented heavenly things;</hi> which are porperties, that enter into the definition of <hi>Legal Levitical ceremonies,</hi> from Scripture; and which, I am aſſured, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> will never bee able to make out concerning <hi>Tithes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet, poor man, hee ſeems to think, hee hath done ſuch wonders, in confuting Tithes, that now, if any dare refuſe to let them go, yet they will not have, hee thinks, the face to take them as, and under the notion of Tythes. And therefore follows, <hi>Neither will it avail, for any to ſay, that they take them not as Tythes; for the</hi> Corinthians <hi>could not bee ſo excuſed, as to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118995:56"/> their eating things ſacrificed to Idols, &amp;c.</hi> Certainly, there is no cauſe to fear, from any thing that hee hath ſaid, that men, that have duely conſidered the thing, ſhould betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that refuge; or to think, they ſhould judge the caſe of <hi>eating things offered to Idols, in the Idols Temple,</hi> and the <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Tythes</hi> alike. Alas! what unequal yoaking of things is here?</p>
               <p>Nay but, Tithes are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and were <hi>ſacrificed to Idols,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly, or interpretatively by <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Not <hi>Popiſh</hi> ſure, in their <hi>inſtitution;</hi> nor ſince <hi>Chriſt,</hi> owned at <hi>firſt,</hi> as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters maintenance, by <hi>Papists,</hi> or to promote directly, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, Popery, or Idolatry. Mr. <hi>P's</hi> reading ſhould have taught him better. Tythes are far <hi>Elder</hi> than <hi>Popery,</hi> even in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church. And however Papiſts have abuſed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Tythes,</hi> or <hi>Temples,</hi> there ariſeth hence, no more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to forſake them, now that thoſe abuſes are renounced, and expelled; than there did to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to aboliſh their Tythes or Temple, becauſe they were uſed during the prevalency of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry in that nation, to maintain it.</p>
               <p>But withall, I muſt minde Mr. <hi>P.</hi> that as to the <hi>Divine right</hi> of Tythes, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhake hands with him, for they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſown it, and diſpute againſt it.</p>
               <p>Now wee are reminded of his injunctions hitherto with a caution.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Away, I ſay, with all appurtenances of a Pariſh Church.<note place="margin">p. 82</note> Let us not deſire the ſilver and gold of the Idol, leſt wee bee ſnared, and become an abomination like it, and accurſed like it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> doth well to comprehend himſelf, and <hi>thoſe</hi> that are <hi>with him</hi> in his admonition to avoid that, which hee deems to be a <hi>curſe.</hi> But he would do better, ſince his judgement is thus, if he did <hi>more</hi> labour to reform <hi>at home,</hi> what he doth ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declaim againſt in others. One lately of his Church, though hee weakly renounced his <hi>Ordination,</hi> yet to his end, would not quit his <hi>Tythes.</hi> Others of the members of his Church, are <hi>Pariſh-Preachers,</hi> and receivers of <hi>Tythes.</hi> May it not now be queried, upon Mr. <hi>P's</hi> principles, whether <hi>his Church</hi> bee <hi>come out of Babylon,</hi> when ſuch <hi>brats of Babylon,</hi> as hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts Pariſh-Miniſters, and receivers of Tythes to bee, are the main Pillars of it, and are ſuffered in it, though they live in a practice directly contrary to their Paſtors Doctrin? Or,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118995:57"/> is it Antichriſtian in all others, to receive Tythes, but not in the Members of Mr. <hi>P's</hi> Society?</p>
               <p>But Reader, is it not <hi>more ſtrange</hi> than this, and matter of wonder, that Mr. <hi>POST LETHWAIT himſelf,</hi> who doth ſo highly inveigh againſt <hi>Tythes,</hi> ſhovld defile <hi>his fingers</hi> with the <hi>ſilver and gold of the IDOL, that accurſed thing</hi> in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and give an <hi>acquittance</hi> for Tythes, by the name of TITHES, <hi>under his own hand,</hi> and that <hi>Since</hi> hee hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in print, in his <hi>Pamphlet against Tythes? I</hi> can aſſure thee, it is not more ſtrange than true. Judge now, what heed is to bee given to his declamations againſt us, who take tithes, which wee judge wee may lawfully receive; whenas, hee can allow himſelf to take them, who profeſſedly condemns them, and accounts them Antichriſtian.</p>
               <p>I ſhall preſume, to give Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſome advice hereupon, and ſo cloſe this Section. 1 I beſeech him, to make ſure, of an actual particular <hi>repentance,</hi> from that ſin againſt his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2 I wiſh him, to <hi>ſtudy</hi> controverted points more <hi>throughly,</hi> before hee adventure, to determine of them ſo peremptorily. 3 I intreat him to conſider, that if his judgement bee ſtill the ſame, concerning Tythes; hee ſhould labour, ſpeedily, to his power, to <hi>reſtore</hi> that Tythe-money, hee hath heretofore received. If it bee <hi>Babyloniſh Gold, an accurſed thing,</hi> gain unjuſtly gotten, why ſhould it <hi>abide</hi> in his Tabernacle, to conſume both it and him? This hee was minded of, by a Pariſh-Miniſter, who breaks bread with him; who told him, that <hi>by the Principles of his book, hee was bound to make reſtitution, of the Tythes, he had at any time received, to the utmoſt of his eſtate.</hi> I hear his evaſion is, hee would make reſtitution, if he knew <hi>to whom.</hi> But, doth not hee know, that when the right owners of goods unlawfully gotten, cannot bee diſcovered, <hi>the Poor are the Heirs, Luke</hi> 19.8? Herewith, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> will do well, to think upon that of <hi>Auſtin, Non aufertur peccatum, niſi reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuat rab latum.</hi>

                  <q>TAke heed, that you ſet not up Epiſcopacy again.<note place="margin">p. 84, 85.</note> Saints are affraid, what the Commiſsioners for the trial of Miniſters will come to at laſt. At firſt, I was pretty well ſatisfied with the Ordinance for their ſitting, ſave that it is grounded in part, on the defence of Patrons rights and properties. But ſince, my ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples increaſe. I know no qualification, that is put on the Patrons preſentation, but only to take care to preſerve his rights and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. Again, is there not the ſame kind of Tyranny exerciſed over the elections of the people, that was formerly? If the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and the Commiſsioners agree, that brings in a Miniſter into a Pariſh, in ſpight of their hearts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I am ſorry to find, and it ſounds very ill towards him, that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> who is ſo <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> a man, ſhould in relation to <hi>Tythes,</hi> as we have ſeen, and the <hi>Commiſsioners trial,</hi> as he tells us here, adventure upon practices, that his ſcruples condemn; and ſo act <hi>againſt his Conſcience.</hi> Surely, this no way becomes ſuch a <hi>Reformer,</hi> and muſt needs lay a great block, in the way of his endeavoured <hi>reclaiming</hi> of thoſe, whom hee accounts to bee in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Though he was <hi>in part ſatisfied</hi> concerning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, yet he tells us, he was <hi>not ſatisfied in them, in that the Ordinance for their ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ting, is grounded on the defence of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons rights and properties.</hi> Now <hi>Patrons,</hi> being in Mr. <hi>P's</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, ſo great an <hi>abomination</hi> as hee doth expreſs; and <hi>Tythes,</hi> which by their approving of him, he had power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and did receive, being in his account an <hi>accurſed thing:</hi> It muſt needs be that he ſinned againſt his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> in <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſsing</hi> himſelf to them, and in <hi>procuring</hi> them, to gratifie him, with ſome of the <hi>gold and ſilver of the Idol.</hi> Should <hi>our</hi> profeſſed Principles, and apparent practices thus jarre, how ill ſhould we hear from Mr. <hi>P?</hi> Surely, whatever Saints of his way are afraid of, Saints of ours ſee cauſe to fear, that he is not a man of ſuch a <hi>tender conſcience,</hi> as he makes ſhew of.</p>
               <p>He fears, <hi>the Commiſsioners will ſet up Epiſcopacy again,</hi> though none of them are of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> judgement, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118995:58"/> of them favour the <hi>Congregational</hi> way. So he fears, with Mr. <hi>Ellis</hi> (p. 95.) that <hi>Popery rective, will follow upon Presbytery;</hi> though the <hi>experience</hi> of Proteſtant reformed Churches, that have exerciſed this Government for above a <hi>hundred</hi> years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and are as farre from Popery rective, as at the firſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid this fear. But indeed (if men muſt ſpeak their <hi>fears</hi>) I fear rather, that thoſe of his rigid way of <hi>ſeparation,</hi> will bring in <hi>Popery</hi> again. <hi>Rective</hi> they may, for <hi>Doctrinal</hi> they have; it hath already crept in, at the back door of their <hi>Democratical</hi> Government, and is too frequently found in many Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of high-flown Sectaries, that have ſwarmed out of their hives.</p>
               <p>But, ſince Mr. <hi>P.</hi> is ſo <hi>ſcrupulo and fear ful,</hi> I wonder hee made no ſcruple, and did not fear (which is a further ſad evidence againſt the <hi>tenderneſs</hi> of his Conſcience) to charge, moſt falſly, the <hi>Protector</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> in ſaying, That <hi>there is no qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion put on the preſentation of the Patron, but only care taken, to preſerve his rights and properties.</hi> For, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> cannot but know, that the Ordinance takes care, that the perſon preſented by any <hi>Patron</hi> to a living, ſhould be a <hi>meet</hi> man to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; which to evidence that he is, he muſt have a <hi>Teſtimonial,</hi> under the hands of godly Miniſters and others, touching his unblameable life and converſation, from their <hi>perſonal</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; which, when the Commiſſioners have received, they are to <hi>make trial</hi> of the grace of God in him, of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, utterance, ability, and fitneſs to preach the Goſpel. And unleſs theſe <hi>evidences,</hi> concur ſo ſufficiently, that they can <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi> of him; no <hi>Patrons preſentation</hi> can avail any man; his <hi>right and property</hi> ſignifies <hi>nothing,</hi> as to the inſtating of ſuch a perſon in any Living. Mr. <hi>P.</hi> may therefore conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee hath not here ſinned againſt that Scripture, <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> 22.28.</p>
               <p>It alſo appears, how <hi>unjuſt</hi> his Charge is, of <hi>Tyranny</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in this buſineſs. It is well known (not to ſpeak now to his fancy, of the <hi>neceſsity of the peoples election,</hi> to which, and to preſentations, ſomething hath been ſaid, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7) that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons</hi> are generally eaſily <hi>prevailed</hi> with by the <hi>People,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any <hi>fit man</hi> they ſhall deſire; and that in caſe an <hi>unfit</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be preſented, people may object againſt him to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and <hi>obſtruct</hi> his paſſing, if they have matter of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118995:58"/> weight againſt him; and in caſe a <hi>preſented</hi> Miniſter prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, or ſcandalous, people know how and where to bee <hi>freed</hi> from him. Unjuſt therefore is his Charge, and rankly uncharitable is that ſpeech, that <hi>if the Patron and Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners agree, that brings in a Miniſter in ſpight of the peoples hearts;</hi> As if, whatever <hi>reaſons</hi> the people ſhew againſt it, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners would doe it <hi>right or wrong.</hi> I heartily wiſh, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> may have grace, to learn more <hi>modeſty, charity, and truth,</hi> than theſe, and many other paſſages in his Treatiſe, manifeſt him to have. He now concludes his Injunctions thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I know, the great Objection againſt what hath been ſaid is, that Miniſters will want their certainty. But for all this,<note place="margin">p. 83.</note> they that truſt in the Lord, will ſay, caſt up, take away the ſtumbling-block, and that with a great deal of fervour. I have refuſed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, when I might have had them, and laid them down, when God called for them.</q> Vincat veritas, ruat coelum.</p>
               <p>What a bitter <hi>inſinuation</hi> is here? that thoſe <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that <hi>caſt not up</hi> their <hi>Tythes,</hi> and <hi>ſtanding,</hi> and turn not <hi>Feakiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,</hi> as Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hath done; are perſons, that <hi>doe not truſt in the Lord:</hi> and that they are <hi>convinced</hi> of the unlawfulneſs of their maintenance and ſtanding, but will not renounce them, for fear of <hi>wanting their certainty.</hi> How hardly doth Mr. <hi>P.</hi> judge, of thoſe that are not of his way? But there are ſome, not only of his way in the main, but alſo of his <hi>Church,</hi> who are Pariſh-Miniſters, and receivers of <hi>Tythes,</hi> and who will not, with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> cry, <hi>Caſt up, take away Tythes;</hi> unleſs they be firſt well aſſured, of a ſetled maintenance another way. And will Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſay of theſe, that they <hi>truſt not the Lord,</hi> and that <hi>fear</hi> of wanting a certainty, makes them act againſt their conſciences? If ſo, having perſiſted in it after admonitions, why communicates he with them? If not, but he judgeth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of them; how is it true which he ſaith, that <hi>thoſe that truſt in the Lord will cry, caſt up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What <hi>Livings</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hath <hi>refuſed,</hi> I know not; but as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as he is, in trumpeting out hereby his <hi>Self-denial:</hi> ſo forward, I think, he is bound in conſcience to bee, to make <hi>reſtitution</hi> of the <hi>ſilver and gold of the Idol</hi> (as hee phraſeth it) which hee hath received, ever ſince he firſt took upon him to preach. Let him <hi>hereby</hi> manifeſt his <hi>fervour,</hi> in ſaying <hi>caſt up;</hi> and, that he ſpoke <hi>from his heart,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Let truth

               <p>I ſuppoſe, hee ſtrikes here at our <hi>Pariſh-Churches, Tithes,</hi> and <hi>Temples,</hi> which have been abundantly proved to bee no Idolatrous things; and which, thoſe pious <hi>writers,</hi> never thought of, when they wrote this; or imagined, that any man would bee ſo <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> as thus to miſ-apply, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their expreſſions.

               <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> may remember time, place, and company, when, where, and in which hee thus expreſt himſelf. <hi>I profeſſe, were I a man in abſolute authority, I would make SCAVINGERS, of all the Pariſh-Prieſts in</hi> England, <hi>to clean the waies, or rake the dunghills.</hi> Reader, art thou not amazed?

               <p>Our Miniſters are no more <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Miniſters, or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts Brokers,</hi> becauſe they received their <hi>Ordination</hi> through <hi>Rome;</hi> than thoſe that have undergone the Ordinance of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> among us, and Mr. <hi>P.</hi> among them are <hi>Antichriſts Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> baptiſed perſons, becauſe the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance came to them through <hi>Rome.

               <p>VVHilſt Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and the <hi>Congregational</hi> Brethren <hi>of his form,</hi> are ſo forward to condemn our Miniſtry as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian;</hi> it will bee hard for them, to free <hi>their own</hi> from that charge. This propoſition I will engage to make good;</p>
               <p>Thoſe Preachers, that are either not at all Ordained, or are ordained only by the People, when they might have been, and might be ordained by a Presbytery of preaching Elders: either they are no Miniſters at all, or their Miniſtry is more liable to the charge of Antichriſtianiſm, than the Miniſtry of any of the Proteſtant Churches.</p>
               <p>For proof hereof let it be conſidered, that as Ordination is by the Word rendered <hi>neceſſary,</hi> when it may be had, for the conſtituting of a Goſpel-Miniſtry: ſo there is no rule, for any other <hi>way of Ordination</hi> of Miniſters left us, in the Word of God, neither by command, nor yet by example, but only <hi>by a Presbytery</hi> of preaching Elders, either extraordinary, or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or mixt. By a Presbytery of preaching Elders, was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination always conferred in Primitive times, on the Officers of the Church. All the texts that ſpeak of Ordination, will bear witneſs to this truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. Church-officers extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, or ordinary, are the perſons ordaining in all theſe places.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118995:62"/> There cannot be one text of Scripture produced, ſo much as for the <hi>concurrence of private Beleevers,</hi> with Officers extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary or ordinary, in the act of ordaining any, though the loweſt Officer in the Church. Therefore, the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters aſſertion holds good, <hi>Ordination of Miniſters by the People, is a perverting of the Ordinance of God; and of no more force than Baptiſm adminiſtred by a Midwife, or the conſecration of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Lords Supper by a perſon out of office.</hi> And, ſince Ordination of Miniſters, by Miniſters of the Goſpel, is the <hi>only way</hi> of ordination warranted in the Word, as the former texts prove: then, <hi>Ordination of Miniſters by the People</hi> muſt needs be an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> way of Ordination, becauſe it wholly croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſts rules for Ordination, given us in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>What is pleaded, for <hi>unordained</hi> perſons aſſuming the holy Office of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> may be eaſily anſwered.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Many of them, are gifted for the Miniſtry.</hi>

That they ſhould be their <hi>own Judges,</hi> in this caſe, is unreaſonable; that <hi>People</hi> ordinarily are not <hi>able</hi> to judge of their gifts, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Who ſo meet to judge of their fitneſs, as Miniſters? and is not this work appropriated to them? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15. compared, &amp; 5.22?</p>

Suppoſe their gifts and qualifications for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, were <hi>proved and approved;</hi> yet, Ordination is neceſſary ordinarily, to <hi>inveſt them into office.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with choyce abilities, for the work of the Miniſtry; yet they take not upon them to be Preachers of the Goſpel, until they are inveſted into office by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Mark 6.7. to 14. So alſo the ſeventy <hi>Diſciples</hi> preach not the Goſpel, until they have a ſpecial Commiſſion from Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.1. to 12. <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> muſt have ſufficient <hi>proof</hi> of mens abilities, and qualifications for the Miniſtry, and then ſuch perſons muſt be inveſted with Office, by <hi>impoſition of the hands of the Presbytery.</hi> This is Gods way, and in it thoſe that would ſerve him ſhould deſire to bee found. <hi>Whereſoever</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin) there is a Church of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Jer. 23.21</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> What <hi>Anabaptiſt, Arminian, Quaker,</hi> may not thus plead? And indeed, in the Schools of <hi>Arminians,</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> was this Doctrin tending to confuſion, and all errour hatched.

               <p>What is pleaded for <hi>Popular Ordination,</hi> comes now to bee conſidered. The <hi>Anſwerers</hi> of <hi>Jus Div. Min. Evangelici,</hi> lay down this propoſition. <hi>In a Church that hath no Officers in it, ſome Beleevers may lawfully, and warrantably Ordain without Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Preacher ſent, p. 323. to p. 330,</note>This they endeavour to prove, by ſix Arguments.</p>
               <p>Arg. 1. <hi>To hold that ſome Beleevers may not lawfully and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably ordain Officers, in a Church that hath none in it, would neceſſarily and unavoidably inferre, Ordination to be in ſuch a caſe unattainable; therefore it is contrary to ſound Doctrin, and not to be aſſerted. For the Antecedent, they ſay, There are no Officers on earth, authorized or appointed by Chriſt, to Ordain (in caſe a Church hath no Officers in it) any more than Beleevers without Officers. In regard, the ſpecial rules and examples left in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l, about Ordination, give no more warrant to Officers to ordain, in ſuch a Church, than Beleevers without them. For, either they were extraordinary Officers that ordained, or had an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118995:63"/> Call to ordain. There is no precept for, or example of any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officer, acting in Ordination (out of the particular Church he is over) upon any ordinary call, in any one text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Argument is built upon a falſe <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> That the Churches of the Goſpel are <hi>Congregational only,</hi> which I have diſproved before. VVere our Churches generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Goſpel-pattern, divers ſingle Congregatious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united in one compleat Church, after the conſtitution of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem, Corinth, Rome,</hi> the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp;c. this <hi>caſe</hi> would hardly fall out that is mentioned. For, though the Officers of a <hi>ſingle</hi> Congregation might fail, yet there would ſtill be a ſufficient <hi>Presbytery</hi> left in that Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Church, to Ordain others in their room.</p>
               <p>But take the caſe as it is, theſe Brethren fall ſhort of proving their Argument; for, 1 Suppoſe, that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Officers,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as Ordainers in other Churches in the New Teſtament, were as to their Office or Call <hi>extraordinary:</hi> yet, how in-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent muſt it needs be that therefore the <hi>People</hi> may ordain? All the precepts and examples, hold forth the Ordainers to bee Church-Officers; none of them give the leaſt hint, of the like power in the people, in any caſe; therefore, ſurely this power is reſtrained to Officers, and denied to the people. That this work belongs to <hi>Officers,</hi> the Precepts and Examples prove clearly; that it belongs in any one caſe to the <hi>People,</hi> let them give us one precept or example. 2 The matter of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they pretend to anſwer, is a ſufficient anſwer to them; That, the <hi>extraordinary</hi> Officers mentioned, might act in this <hi>as ordinary Officers,</hi> and ſo their acting may warrant or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers in ordaining, even in the caſe they mention. Officers are appointed to Ordain, the impoſition of the hands of the Presbytery is required in Ordination, ordained Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers had it in thoſe Primitive times (whoſe practice is our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern) though from Miniſters, that belonged not in particular to the Congregations for which they were ordained; and, will it not hence follow, that in <hi>unpresbyterated</hi> Churches, <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of other Churches</hi> are to ordain Miniſters? If not, (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort theſe Brethrens reaſoning, and uſe it more conſequently than they doe) <hi>Ordination will be in ſuch Churches unattainable;</hi> for Chriſt, who hath given expreſly power for it to Church-Officers, hath no where given it to the people. Their <hi>Medium,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:118995:64"/> will better ſerve againſt them, than for them. 3 It is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as that they ſay ſometimes the contrary, that there was then ordination by <hi>ordinary Officers. Act.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. ſpeaks of Ordination by ordinary Officers at <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſuch certainly were many there, and it is a wonder theſe Brethren ſhould queſtion it; What, no ordinary Officers at <hi>Antioch? The Presbytery at</hi> Antioch (ſaies the <hi>New-England</hi> plat-form) <hi>laid hands upon</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas;<note place="margin">Platform. p. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>The Presbytery at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>upon</hi> Timothy <hi>an Evangeliſt. Ordinary Officers laid hands upon the Officers of many Churches. Where there are no Elders, wee ſee not why im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands may not bee performed by the Elders of other Churches.</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>did ordain with impoſition of hands,</hi> in <hi>Unpresbytered</hi> Churches, but they laid not on hands <hi>alone,</hi> but with a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> for ſo had <hi>Paul</hi> appointed them, as muſt bee confeſſed, unleſſe (which is groundleſſe and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable) wee do ſuppoſe <hi>Paul's</hi> command and directions, to croſs his own practice. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. But, ſay theſe Brethren, <hi>thoſe Presbyteries had an Extraordinary Call, they acted not in ſuch Ordinations upon an ordinary call.</hi> That is eaſily ſaid, but they would have done well to have <hi>proved</hi> that their cal was extraordinary. They do not do it, they cannot do it.</p>
               <p>'Tis warrant then enough, for Ordination in Unpresbytera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches, by Presbyteries, Miniſters of other Churches, and againſt the peoples Ordination; that Ordination, is made by the word the work of a Presbytery, and ſignified to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſuch Churches by a Presbytery, which theſe Brethren cannot prove to have had an extraordinary call to it; and that it is no where made the work of the people, or ſignified to have been performed in any caſe by them.</p>
               <p>Argum. 2 <hi>In a Church that hath no Officers, either ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers may ordain without Officers,</hi>

               <p>Their harping upon the <hi>extraordinarineſs</hi> of the Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which the New-Teſtament mentions, cannot enervate the argument; no not if they could prove, that <hi>none</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers ordained, in the places in relation to which Ordination is mentioned, which they can never do: for ſtill it remaines, that it is the <hi>work of Officers,</hi> and put upon and practiſed by <hi>none elſe:</hi> Therefore, if Ordination be to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church, after the ceſſation of extraordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, it is the work of ordinary Officers, and of none elſe.</p>
               <p>Wee read of none, that adminiſtred the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> but <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Officers, the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles, Act.</hi> 2. and <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20.11. and the Commiſſion given by Chriſt <hi>(This do,)</hi> in the inſtitution of this Ordinance, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Officers, even to his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But, will
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118995:65"/> it hence follow, that the Adminiſtration of this Ordinance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to ordinary Officers, and to them onely, now? Yet, by theſe Brethrens way of arguing, this may bee as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as what they do contend for. Their <hi>begged ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that there is no Scripture-warrant for any other Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, but that onely which is in a particular Congregation; and no rule, to juſtify a Presbyteries putting forth any acts, as a Presbytery, towards any but the particular members of that Congregation, where they are fixed (which is another <hi>falſe hypotheſis</hi> they build upon) I ſhall not here conſider, having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to it in this Treatiſe.</p>

All reformed Churches condemn the practice of ſuch perſons, as Antiſcriptural, that without Ordination, take upon them to bee Preachers, in a conſtituted Church; allowing them to Preach, onely for <hi>Probation,</hi> in order to Ordination deſired by them. As for their Argument, and the Reaſon of it, they are very wilde. For, were it granted, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers that are no Officers, might <hi>ordinarily Preach,</hi> yet they themſelves will grant, they preach not as <hi>Officers.</hi> But <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> they cannot finde in Scripture (neither do they ſay they do) committed to, or performed by any, but Officers; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is an <hi>act of Office,</hi> and ſo, it no way follows, that if Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers may preach (as no Officers) they may alſo Ordain. But (ſay they) <hi>Ordination, is not more limitted or reſtrained to Officers, than Preaching.</hi> Well, but what <hi>Preaching</hi> mean they? <hi>Extraordinary, occaſionall, probational</hi> preaching, is not ſo much limitted or reſtrained to Officers, as Ordination; but <hi>Authoritative</hi> preaching, is as much reſtrained to them as Ordination, and Ordination as that.

                  <hi>ſo great a work as Preaching; therefore, if beleevers may Preach, they may Ordain.</hi> Alas! is the Preaching the Scripture mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the preaching of <hi>private Beleevers,</hi> or of <hi>Officers?</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Argument, and their Reaſon ſpeak not <hi>ad i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture magnifies an <hi>authoritative Preaching</hi> of the Goſpel, by Church-Officers above other acts; Theſe Brethren, ſpeak of the <hi>preaching of gifted Brethren out of Office,</hi> which is not <hi>authoritative;</hi> and then tell us they may Ordain, becauſe they may Preach, which is the greater work.

               <p>Argum. 4 <hi>Some Beleevers may with Chriſts allowance act in other publike ſpecial Church-works, and ſuch, as that there can be no ſpecial reaſon given, againſt their ordaining, more than againſt their doing thoſe other works.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If their propoſition were true, yet they could gain nothing by it; for it is <hi>Reaſon</hi> enough againſt <hi>private Beleevers</hi> Ordaining, that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> hath expreſly put this work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Officers,</hi> and no where upon private Beleevers. But, they are far from proving what they ſay. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2. ſpeaks in all probability, of the Officers of the Church at <hi>Antioch onely;</hi> read 1, 2, 3. verſes.

That they were <hi>all Teachers,</hi> the 32. verſe alſo evinceth.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118995:66"/> in a Synod, that may not ordain)</hi> give them no ſufficient ground thus to ſpeak, and are much miſtaken by them, as by what hath been ſaid, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. of this Treatiſe may appear. The <hi>whole Church,</hi> may mean that <hi>Synodical</hi> Church. The <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> are mentioned, to ſignify their <hi>conſent</hi> to what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed; Yet it cannot bee proved, that <hi>private Brethren,</hi> much leſſe that the <hi>whole Church</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were <hi>preſent</hi> at the <hi>Synod.</hi>

And, though the private Brethren are mentioned, as <hi>conſenting</hi> to the Decrees; yet, as it inferres not that there was a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of their conſent: So doth it not at all prove, that they <hi>concurred in making the Decrees,</hi> for then, they had been their <hi>Decrees.</hi> But, as <hi>they</hi> are not ſaid to <hi>come together to conſider of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but onely the <hi>Apoſtles and Elders,</hi> verſ. 6. (though it is poſſible ſome of them might bee there, to hear how it was conſidered of) So, the Decrees are not called <hi>their Decrees,</hi> but expreſly <hi>the Deerees ordained of the Apoſtles and Elders,</hi> Act. 16.4.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Brethren</hi> are taken into the inſcription of the Letter, is farre from proving, that they <hi>concurred in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Decrees,</hi> or had any <hi>joynt power,</hi> with the Apoſtles and Elders, in <hi>impoſing</hi> them; Becauſe, it is frequent, for the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the New-Teſtament, to take into their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, for <hi>Salutation,</hi> and by way of <hi>conſent</hi> to what is written, thoſe who cannot bee reputed, to have had <hi>joynt power</hi> with the Writer of them; and of whom, all that is ſpoken, even <hi>without limitation,</hi> cannot bee affirmed, &amp;c. as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. and other places.</p>
               <p>Theſe Brethren, therefore, are too too weakly confident, in ſaying, <hi>Either our Brethren muſt ſay, that ſome Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers may ordain; or elſe, That men may act in making de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in a Synod, that may not ordain:</hi> It is denyed them, that private Beleevers may <hi>act in making Decrees in a Synod,</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:118995:66"/> and that they did it in that Synod; and they have not proved, nor will ever bee able to prove it.</p>
               <p>That other place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.18, 19, 23. helps them not at all neither. For, it doth not appear, that theſe <hi>meſſengers</hi> were any of them <hi>private</hi> Beleevers; nor that they were <hi>choſen and ſent by private Beleevers;</hi> and if they had, what can they infer from hence for private Brethrens <hi>ordaining?</hi> Nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by all their Logick. <hi>Meſſengers are choſen by the Churches, to carry their contribution to neceſſitous Brethren, Therefere, they may depute private Beleevers</hi> (to whom Chriſt never gave power for it) <hi>to ordain Miniſters.</hi> Who ſees not the weakneſſe of this conſequence? is there any equality, or analogy between theſe acts?</p>
               <p>Arg. 5. <hi>Thoſe that give the eſſence of the Call to Office,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Preacher ſent. p. 337.</note> 
                  <hi>may alſo give the adjunct. But ſome Beleevers without Officers, do give the eſſence of the call to Office; For Election is that which giveth the eſſence to the outward call to Office, and that belongeth to a Church (of beleevers without Officers)</hi> Ergo, <hi>they may give the adjunct, Ordination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is another <hi>falſe Hypotheſis</hi> of theirs, and a main cauſe of their many miſtakes, that <hi>Election gives the eſſence of the call to Office,</hi> nay, the <hi>whole</hi> eſſence of it, p. 242. and that Ordination is but an adjunct.</p>
               <p>But, becauſe this point is largely diſcuſſed, between the Reverend <hi>Authors of Juſ. Div. Min.</hi> and them; I ſhall ſay the leſs to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1 If Election did give the Eſſence of the Call to Office, and Ordination were but an adjunct; yet it follows not, that <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> beleevers may ordain. Becauſe, whatever <hi>ordination</hi> bee, Chriſt hath made it <hi>the work of Officers,</hi> and no where of the People, as hath been ſaid. Their reaſonings will do them no good, without a <hi>Precept,</hi> or <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 If Election did give the whole eſſence of the Call to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, yet, it follows not that the <hi>Peoples Election alone</hi> doth do it. Surely, <hi>Ministers</hi> have an <hi>electing Power</hi> alſo. When <hi>Titus</hi> is appointed to <hi>ordain,</hi> to conſtitute <hi>Elders in every City,</hi> hee is charged to look, that they bee ſuch, as were <hi>able to convince gain-ſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.5, 9. and that <hi>ordinarily,</hi> private Beleevers, yea, <hi>Churches of private beleevers,</hi> are not ſufficient to judge
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:118995:67"/> of, nor any where <hi>appointed</hi> Judges of it. If then, the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> who are the proper Judges of this, do not <hi>approve</hi> and <hi>chuſe</hi> as ſuch perſons, thoſe whom the <hi>People chuſe;</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples choice hath no validity in it, and ſo doth not conſtitute them Miniſters. In vain ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> tell <hi>Titus,</hi> what abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Elders ſhould bee found by him to have, in order to his conſtituting them in every City; if the people might chuſe men, whom hee judged unable, and their election ſtand valid.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If Election did give the eſſence of the Call to the Office of <hi>Elderſhip,</hi> yet theſe Brethren cannot prove from Scripture, that it belongs to <hi>private Beleevers,</hi> as giving ſuch a Call. No Scripture, that I know of, gives power to people, to <hi>chuſe their Elders,</hi> ſo as to give them thereby a <hi>Call to Office.</hi> They may chuſe them in order to the exerciſe of their Miniſterial Office among them; but, do not by that choice, <hi>confer</hi> the Miniſterial <hi>Office</hi> upon them; no nor <hi>empower them,</hi> to exerciſe that office among them. The Scriptures commonly urged for it, prove no ſuch thing. For which ſee <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. of this book, about the the end. That <hi>Miniſters</hi> have power to <hi>chuſe and ſet Elders</hi> in the Churches, that mentioned place in <hi>Titus</hi> proves. That <hi>People</hi> have ſuch an electing power, no Scripture proves. There is ſome <hi>ſhew,</hi> of their power to chuſe <hi>Deacons,</hi> but not <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> and that choice, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. doth not appear to have <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted</hi> them ſuch. Beſides, there is a great deal of difference between chuſing thoſe who are to look to the goods of the Church, and thoſe who are to watch over the ſouls of the Church, and to rule them in the Lord. The Deacons are the Churches <hi>Servants,</hi> but Elders their <hi>Rulers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 That <hi>Ordination gives the eſſence of the Call to Offfice,</hi> the Authors they anſwer have proved; and will, I ſuppoſe, vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their proofs from what they have ſaid againſt them, if they ſhall finde it to bee <hi>tanti.</hi> The very firſt of them, from the New Teſtament, is ſufficient to conclude this, which is concerning <hi>Deacons,</hi> an Office inferiour to <hi>Elderſhip, Act.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Look ye out among you</hi> (ſay the Apoſtles) <hi>ſeven men, whom wee may appoint over this buſineſſe.</hi> They cannot bee deemed to have had the Eſſence of the call to Office, till they were <hi>appointed to it; the looking of them out,</hi> did not <hi>appoint</hi> them to it; the <hi>ſetting them before the Apoſtles,</hi> did not <hi>appoint</hi> them to it, for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:118995:67"/> it is whom <hi>we</hi> (not <hi>you) may appoint.</hi> Appointed to it they were then, by the Apoſtles <hi>laying of hands on them with prayer.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Apoſtles Ordaining them, with prayer and impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, gave them <hi>the eſſence of the call to office;</hi> and ſo <hi>Ordination gives the eſſence of the call to office,</hi> and is not <hi>an adjunct.</hi> This Argument then, is farre from proving that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may ordain.</p>
               <p>Arg. 6. <hi>If Ordination conſiſteth in,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Preacher ſent, p. 338, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>or be made up of ſuch acts only, as Beleevers may undoubtedly perform, and theſe acts be not limited in their uſe, upon this occaſion, to Officers only; then, in a Church which hath no Officers, ſome beleevers may lawfully and warrantably ordain without Officers. But, Ordination conſiſteth, &amp;c. Ergo.</hi> The minor they endeavour to prove, by ſaying, that, <hi>The three things belonging to Ordination on the part of the Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, faſting, prayer, impoſition of hands, may be all performed by Beleevers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is exceeding weak. That private beleevers may <hi>joyn</hi> with the Ordainers, in <hi>faſting and prayer,</hi> none deny, but what is that to the purpoſe? That Ordination <hi>conſiſts in prayer</hi> (as they ſay) we deny, and they can never prove it. It conſiſts in <hi>miſſion, appointing, ſetting apart;</hi> which, Scripture precepts, and examples, teach us doe belong to <hi>Officers,</hi> and no where hints to belong to the <hi>People.</hi> That <hi>private</hi> beleevers may <hi>lay on hands on Officers in Ordination,</hi> no Scripture proves; <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.10. is farre from it; for, 1. Nothing can be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded from <hi>Moſaical Ceremonies,</hi> for practices under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> unleſs they bee there <hi>opened,</hi> and the practices there confirmed, by <hi>precept or example;</hi> and this might be anſwer enough. 2. They are told, that <hi>thoſe of the People who laid on hands, had a command to doe it</hi> (their talking of <hi>mediate</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> is to little purpoſe) but there is no ſuch <hi>command,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or included in the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> And will they ſay, from <hi>that command,</hi> that there is now <hi>a neceſſity</hi> of the <hi>peoples laying on hands in Ordination?</hi> They muſt ſay it if they will make uſe of this text their way; and then it will follow, there have been none rightly ordained for one thouſand ſix hundred years ſince Chriſt. 3. It is clear from this eighth of <hi>Numbers,</hi> by reading the following verſes, that the <hi>Levites</hi> being taken inſtead of the <hi>firſt-born,</hi> which were Gods by his appointment,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118995:68"/> 
                  <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 17, 18. the <hi>people,</hi> whoever of them they were, did by this <hi>Ceremony</hi> only declare, that they cloſed with the Lords <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi> and deſired the Levites might according to it, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and taken in the <hi>room</hi> of the firſt born; and therefore, they are called, <hi>an offering of the children of Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 11. they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them by Gods appointment to the Lord, inſtead of the firſt-born, and the laying on of hands was a <hi>ſign</hi> thereof. After this, ſacrifices being offered for them, and they <hi>offered to the Lord</hi> by <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>his ſons,</hi> verſ. 12, 13. they were to enter upon their Office, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15. Now, what analogy is there, between the Peoples offering of the Levites, with impoſition of hands, upon ſuch a <hi>ſpecial</hi> reaſon and account, and but <hi>in order</hi> to their being conſtituted Officers, and admitted to the ſervice of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which they were afterwards by <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons: and the <hi>ordaining</hi> of Miniſters, with impoſitions of hands by <hi>the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and that <hi>without Officers,</hi> now under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> where we have clearly, inſtitution, and example, to declare it to be the <hi>Miniſters</hi> work?</p>
               <p>They proceed to ſay; <hi>None of the texts, which ſpeak of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, limit it to Officers only. Let our brethren prove any ſuch limitation, elſe private beleevers may warrantably or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VVhat <hi>Readers,</hi> did theſe Brethren think, their Book would meet with, to urge this reaſoning, again and again, as an argument for popular Ordination? They might have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, how eaſie the proof is. <hi>Either it is limited to Officers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or committed to others as well as them; But it is not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to others; therefore it is limited to Officers only.</hi> Let them ſhew, by Scripture-precept, or example, out of the New Teſtament, that it is committed to <hi>others;</hi> elſe, private be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers Ordaining, muſt needs remain <hi>unwarrantable.</hi> Let them ſhew private Beleevers <hi>warrant,</hi> as Miniſters can theirs. We prove it is <hi>committed to Officers,</hi> they cannot prove it is <hi>committed to others;</hi> doth it not then follow that <hi>it is limited to Officers only.</hi> May they not by their way of reaſoning, as well ſay that <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> as ſuch, may <hi>ordain</hi> Miniſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not by name excluded? and ſo ſcrew <hi>Eraſtus</hi> his way one pin higher, than ever he durſt bring it to? Nay, may they not, by this reaſoning, argue that <hi>private</hi> beleevers
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118995:68"/> may <hi>adminiſter the Sacraments,</hi> ſince no place of Scripture doth expreſs the adminiſtration of them to be <hi>limited to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> by excluding the people from it?</p>
               <p>Theſe Brethrens Arguments, then, are not at all <hi>concluſive</hi> for their purpoſe. The Holy Ghoſt hath committed Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Miniſters, and no where to the people; for them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to act in it, is a groſs and very ſinful <hi>uſurpation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence alſo it will follow, that <hi>people</hi> cannot, without ſin, own <hi>unordained</hi> perſons, or ſuch as are ordained only <hi>by the People,</hi> as Miniſters of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As theſe may bee juſtly charged, to <hi>run before they are ſent,</hi> as thoſe did, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.21. ſo thoſe may be charged juſtly, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> about their Kings, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.4. to <hi>ſet up</hi> Paſtors <hi>but not by him,</hi> and Miniſters <hi>but he knew not</hi> (approved not) <hi>of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, let ſuch <hi>ſuppoſed Miniſters,</hi> bee humbled for their raſh <hi>intruſion,</hi> and ſeek for Ordination at the hands of <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſters;</hi> And <hi>People,</hi> who have ſuch Paſtors, urge them to it, and upon their refuſal and neglect of it, let them know, that they cannot own them as <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>SInce, notwithſtanding the Criminations of the <hi>Accuſer,</hi> whom this Book anſwereth; and the ſeveral charges from others; <hi>our Churches</hi> remain <hi>true Churches</hi> of Chriſt, and need not <hi>new making,</hi> but <hi>reforming;</hi> and <hi>our Miniſtry a true Miniſtry;</hi> and that it appears, that <hi>ſuch only are lawful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and Embaſſadours for him</hi> (among us who have a conſtituted Church,) <hi>as have been ordained by a Presbytery of preaching Elders:</hi> My humble requeſt to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> of our Land, is,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That they would <hi>improve</hi> to their utmoſt, the <hi>power</hi> put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, by the King of the Church <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> in our Churches; by ſtirring up, and enjoyning <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> to lay out themſelves more fully, for the inſtructing, admoniſhing, and reforming, of the flocks committed to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118995:69"/> them; and <hi>people,</hi> to receive, yeeld, and ſubmit, unto their Miniſterial labours, and authority, in order to the due uſe of all the Ordinances of Chriſt, and ſuch a converſation as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Goſpel. And that therefore, they would bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to countenance, and enjoyn, the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ceſſary works of <hi>Catechiſing,</hi> and <hi>private inſtruction;</hi> and, by their authority, to ſtrengthen the hands of Chriſts Miniſters, in their keeping the Ordinances of Chriſt, and particularly that of his <hi>Supper,</hi> from profanation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That they would take care, that every Congregation, ſo farre as may be, ſtand furniſhed with a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>rightly qualified, and inveſted into office, by Ordination, received from Miniſters of the Gospel,</hi> according to Chriſts inſtitution. <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> ſent none with his Princes, to teach the People the Law of God, but <hi>Levites,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> perſons regularly <hi>inveſted with office,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.8, 9. The Churches of God, in Primitive times, in after ages, at this day, in <hi>Scotland, France, Sweden, Denmark, Helvetia, Germany,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands, New-England,</hi> all the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Churches in <hi>England,</hi> yea of <hi>Congregational</hi> Churches almoſt <hi>all,</hi> doe with one conſent affirm, that <hi>authoritative preaching of the Word, and diſpenſing of the Sacraments,</hi> belong only to a lawfully <hi>Ordained Miniſtry.</hi> I beſeech our Rulers, in the bowels of Chriſt, that effectual care bee taken, that all our Miniſters may be ſuch; that <hi>countenance, publick places,</hi> and <hi>publick maintenance,</hi> bee afforded only to ſuch. How ſhould wee expect our comforts ſhould bee dear to God, if wee are not zealous for that, which ſo nearly concerns his glory?</p>
               <p n="3">3 That they would be pleaſed, effectually to <hi>ſuppreſs,</hi> to their power, all <hi>Blaſphemies, Hereſies,</hi> and <hi>Anti-fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Errours;</hi> that they may not bee <hi>written, taught, vented, promoted,</hi> to the prejudice of the Truth, trouble of the Church, and endangering the immortal <hi>Souls</hi> of people; and that men may not have liberty to defame, and every <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero</hi> to rail at, and charge with <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ways of God, which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have generally owned, and ſealed their teſtimony unto, with the <hi>bloud</hi> of multitudes of <hi>Martyrs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:118995:69"/>
               <p>Then would <hi>their light break forth as the morning,</hi> and <hi>the glory of the Lord would be their rereward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let <hi>timid</hi> ſpirits cry out of <hi>Lions in the way,</hi> and fear, that if there bee an <hi>owning of thorow Reformation,</hi> erroneous and looſe perſons will bee <hi>diſcontented,</hi> and ready to joyn with forreign enemies, to diſturb the publick peace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ruine of Church and State. But, let <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who are the <hi>Miniſters of God,</hi> and bear his Name, <hi>zealouſly</hi> goe through with the work of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and expect confidently protection, and a bleſſing from him in it; ſetting before them that excellent pattern, <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 Chron. 17. whoſe care, and zeal for <hi>Reformation,</hi> was remarkably owned, and rewarded by God; for, <hi>He ſtabliſhed the Kingdom in his hand, all</hi> Judah <hi>brought him preſents, and the</hi> Philiſtines <hi>and</hi> Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>tribute, he had riches and honour in abundance, and the fear of the Lord fell upon the Kingdoms of the Lands, that were round about</hi> Judah, <hi>ſo that they made no warre against</hi> Jehoſaphat. Thus will the Lord reward, <hi>Rulers</hi> that are <hi>zealous</hi> for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and againſt whatſoever ſtrikes at it; And our <hi>Supream Magiſtrate,</hi> and <hi>Chief Rulers,</hi> may, in the diſcharge of this work, look for like ſucceſs.</p>

               <head>SECT. XIV. Of Mr. <hi>P's</hi> concluſion, abuſing that of the Lord <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> his Book.</head>
               <p>I <hi>Shall conclude all, with that noble Speech,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 95, 96.</note> 
                  <hi>of that noble Lord</hi> Du Pleſſis. <hi>May we not lawfully ſay with the Prophet, We would have cured</hi> Babel, <hi>but ſhe would not be cured? forſake her, and let us goe every one to his own Country, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no ſmall <hi>aggravation</hi> of this mans ſin, in <hi>renouncing Proteſtant Churches,</hi> and declaiming againſt them as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian; that, he doth ſo groſly <hi>abuſe,</hi> in many places of his Pamphlet, the exhortations, and expreſſions of their Writers, ſo as to out-ſtrip therein in impudence, the Papiſts themſelves. And yet, he is ſo inſenſible of the evil of this miſcarriage, that hee dares, to <hi>conclude</hi> his Treatiſe with it; (for though he marks but eight lines as <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> his words; his two laſt pages, from
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:118995:70"/> the beginning of the words now mentioned, to the end of his Book, are <hi>verbatim,</hi> the tranſlated concluſion of <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> his Book.) Now, how highly <hi>unworthy</hi> this carriage of his is, appears, in that, 1. He ſmooths, and ſpeaks honourably, of this Lord (whom the very drift of his Book caſts diſgrace upon, he being a main aſſertor and defender of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church-State) calling his Speech, <hi>that noble Speech, of that noble Lord.</hi> VVherein, he is exceeding like thoſe <hi>Phariſees,</hi> againſt whom Chriſt pronounceth a woe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.29. 2. He groſly wreſts his exhortation, which is to ſeparation from <hi>Rome;</hi> in preſſing it, for ſeparation from <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, which never came into this Lords heart. 3. He ſhamefully abuſeth his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is to cloſe with, and <hi>get, to that holy Mountain, the little</hi> Zoar, <hi>Gods Church, how ſmall and contemptible ſoever in the eyes of the world</hi> (by which he meant <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches) in managing it, for joyning with <hi>ſeparate</hi> Congregational Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as diſtinct, and ſeparating from thoſe Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> and ſetting up a Democratical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contrary to theirs; which <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> would have abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the very thought of. If he <hi>doth not</hi> (as he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 95.) <hi>ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upbraid any,</hi> explicitely; yet, ſurely, he doth implicitely <hi>upbraid</hi> this <hi>Lord,</hi> and all <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> with owning an Antichriſtian Church-ſtate; and withall foulely abuſeth their admonitions to ſeparate from <hi>Rome,</hi> in urging them for ſeparation from <hi>them;</hi> as if they had <hi>condemned their own ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> which they are ſufficiently known to have throughly aſſerted as Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The Lord give Mr. <hi>P.</hi> repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth; and deliver him, and all others of his mind, from their deluding apprehenſions, and ſinful ſeparation. <hi>Amen.</hi>
